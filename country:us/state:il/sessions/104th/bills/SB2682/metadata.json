Changes the short title of the Act to the Therapist Abuse Prevention and Accountability Act. Provides that a cause of action against a therapist or unlicensed health professional for abuse exists for a client or former client for injury caused by the abuse by the therapist or unlicensed health professional, if the abuse occurred: (1) during the period the client was receiving therapy from the therapist or health services from the unlicensed health professional or (2) within 2 years after the period the client received therapy from the therapist or health services from the unlicensed health professional. Provides that the consent of the client or former client is not a defense to a cause of action under this provision.
