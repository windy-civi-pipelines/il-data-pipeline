As used in this subsection (c):16    "Decommissioning" has the meaning given to that term in 17subsection (a) of Section 8-508.1.18    "Nuclear power reactor" has the meaning given to that term 19in Section 8 of the Nuclear Safety Law of 2004. 20    After the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 21103rd General Assembly, no construction shall commence on any 22new nuclear power reactor with a nameplate capacity of more 23than 300 megawatts of electricity to be located within this 24State, and no certificate of public convenience and necessity 25or other authorization shall be issued therefor by the 26Commission, until the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and   HB4122- 7 -LRB104 15316 AAS 28470 b1Office of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Illinois 2Environmental Protection Agency and the Illinois Department of 3Natural Resources, finds that the United States Government, 4through its authorized agency, has identified and approved a 5demonstrable technology or means for the disposal of high 6level nuclear waste, or until such construction has been 7specifically approved by a statute enacted by the General 8Assembly. Beginning January 1, 2026, construction may commence 9on a new nuclear power reactor with a nameplate capacity of 300 10megawatts of electricity or less within this State if the 11entity constructing the new nuclear power reactor has obtained 12all permits, licenses, permissions, or approvals governing the 13construction, operation, and funding of decommissioning of 14such nuclear power reactors required by: (1) this Act; (2) any 15rules adopted by the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and 16Office of Homeland Security under the authority of this Act; 17(3) any applicable federal statutes, including, but not 18limited to, the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, the Energy 19Reorganization Act of 1974, the Low-Level Radioactive Waste 20Policy Amendments Act of 1985, and the Energy Policy Act of 211992; (4) any regulations promulgated or enforced by the U.S. 22Nuclear Regulatory Commission, including, but not limited to, 23those codified at Title X, Parts 20, 30, 40, 50, 70, and 72 of 24the Code of Federal Regulations, as from time to time amended; 25and (5) any other federal or State statute, rule, or 26regulation governing the permitting, licensing, operation, or   HB4122- 8 -LRB104 15316 AAS 28470 b1decommissioning of such nuclear power reactors. None of the 2rules developed by the Illinois Emergency Management Agency 3and Office of Homeland Security or any other State agency, 4board, or commission pursuant to this Act shall be construed 5to supersede the authority of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 6Commission. The changes made by this amendatory Act of the 7103rd General Assembly shall not apply to the uprate, renewal, 8or subsequent renewal of any license for an existing nuclear 9power reactor that began operation prior to the effective date 10of this amendatory Act of the 103rd General Assembly. 11    None of the changes made in this amendatory Act of the 12103rd General Assembly are intended to authorize the 13construction of nuclear power plants powered by nuclear power 14reactors that are not either: (1) small modular nuclear 15reactors; or (2) nuclear power reactors licensed by the U.S. 16Nuclear Regulatory Commission to operate in this State prior 17to the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 103rd 18General Assembly. 19    (d) In making its determination under subsection (b) of 20this Section, the Commission shall attach primary weight to 21the cost or cost savings to the customers of the utility. The 22Commission may consider any or all factors which will or may 23affect such cost or cost savings, including the public 24utility's engineering judgment regarding the materials used 25for construction.26    (e) The Commission may issue a temporary certificate which   HB4122- 9 -LRB104 15316 AAS 28470 b1shall remain in force not to exceed one year in cases of 2emergency, to assure maintenance of adequate service or to 3serve particular customers, without notice or hearing, pending 4the determination of an application for a certificate, and may 5by regulation exempt from the requirements of this Section 6temporary acts or operations for which the issuance of a 7certificate will not be required in the public interest.8    A public utility shall not be required to obtain but may 9apply for and obtain a certificate of public convenience and 10necessity pursuant to this Section with respect to any matter 11as to which it has received the authorization or order of the 12Commission under the Electric Supplier Act, and any such 13authorization or order granted a public utility by the 14Commission under that Act shall as between public utilities be 15deemed to be, and shall have except as provided in that Act the 16same force and effect as, a certificate of public convenience 17and necessity issued pursuant to this Section.18    No electric cooperative shall be made or shall become a 19party to or shall be entitled to be heard or to otherwise 20appear or participate in any proceeding initiated under this 21Section for authorization of power plant construction and as 22to matters as to which a remedy is available under the Electric 23Supplier Act.24    (f) Such certificates may be altered or modified by the 25Commission, upon its own motion or upon application by the 26person or corporation affected. Unless exercised within a   HB4122- 10 -LRB104 15316 AAS 28470 b1period of 2 years from the grant thereof, authority conferred 2by a certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the 3Commission shall be null and void.4    No certificate of public convenience and necessity shall 5be construed as granting a monopoly or an exclusive privilege, 6immunity or franchise.7    (g) A public utility that undertakes any of the actions 8described in items (1) through (3) of this subsection (g) or 9that has obtained approval pursuant to Section 8-406.1 of this 10Act shall not be required to comply with the requirements of 11this Section to the extent such requirements otherwise would 12apply. For purposes of this Section and Section 8-406.1 of 13this Act, "high voltage electric service line" means an 14electric line having a design voltage of 100,000 or more. For 15purposes of this subsection (g), a public utility may do any of 16the following:17        (1) replace or upgrade any existing high voltage 18    electric service line and related facilities, 19    notwithstanding its length;20        (2) relocate any existing high voltage electric 21    service line and related facilities, notwithstanding its 22    length, to accommodate construction or expansion of a 23    roadway or other transportation infrastructure; or24        (3) construct a high voltage electric service line and 25    related facilities that is constructed solely to serve a 26    single customer's premises or to provide a generator   HB4122- 11 -LRB104 15316 AAS 28470 b1    interconnection to the public utility's transmission 2    system and that will pass under or over the premises owned 3    by the customer or generator to be served or under or over 4    premises for which the customer or generator has secured 5    the necessary right of way. 6    (h) A public utility seeking to construct a high-voltage 7electric service line and related facilities (Project) must 8show that the utility has held a minimum of 2 pre-filing public 9meetings to receive public comment concerning the Project in 10each county where the Project is to be located, no earlier than 116 months prior to filing an application for a certificate of 12public convenience and necessity from the Commission. Notice 13of the public meeting shall be published in a newspaper of 14general circulation within the affected county once a week for 153 consecutive weeks, beginning no earlier than one month prior 16to the first public meeting. If the Project traverses 2 17contiguous counties and where in one county the transmission 18line mileage and number of landowners over whose property the 19proposed route traverses is one-fifth or less of the 20transmission line mileage and number of such landowners of the 21other county, then the utility may combine the 2 pre-filing 22meetings in the county with the greater transmission line 23mileage and affected landowners. All other requirements 24regarding pre-filing meetings shall apply in both counties. 25Notice of the public meeting, including a description of the 26Project, must be provided in writing to the clerk of each   HB4122- 12 -LRB104 15316 AAS 28470 b1county where the Project is to be located. A representative of 2the Commission shall be invited to each pre-filing public 3meeting.4    (h-5) A public utility seeking to construct a high-voltage 5electric service line and related facilities must also show 6that the Project has complied with training and competence 7requirements under subsection (b) of Section 15 of the 8Electric Transmission Systems Construction Standards Act. 9    (i) For applications filed after August 18, 2015 (the 10effective date of Public Act 99-399), the Commission shall, by 11certified mail, notify each owner of record of land, as 12identified in the records of the relevant county tax assessor, 13included in the right-of-way over which the utility seeks in 14its application to construct a high-voltage electric line of 15the time and place scheduled for the initial hearing on the 16public utility's application. The utility shall reimburse the 17Commission for the cost of the postage and supplies incurred 18for mailing the notice.19(Source: P.A. 102-609, eff. 8-27-21; 102-662, eff. 9-15-21; 20102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 102-931, eff. 5-27-22; 103-569, eff. 216-1-24; 103-1066, eff. 2-20-25.) 22    Section 10. The Illinois Nuclear Facility Safety Act is 23amended by changing Section 2 and by adding Section 8 as 24follows:   HB4122- 13 -LRB104 15316 AAS 28470 b1    (420 ILCS 10/2)  (from Ch. 111 1/2, par. 4352)2    Sec. 2. Policy statement. It is declared to be the policy 3of the State of Illinois to prevent accidents at nuclear 4facilities in Illinois for the economic well-being of the 5People of the State of Illinois and for the health and safety 6of workers at nuclear facilities and private citizens who 7could be injured as a result of releases of radioactive 8materials from nuclear facilities. It is also declared to be 9the policy of the State to facilitate new nuclear facility 10construction. It is the intent of the General Assembly that 11this Act should be construed consistently with federal law to 12maximize the role of the State in contributing to safety at 13nuclear facilities in Illinois and the facilitation of new 14nuclear facility construction. It is the intent of the General 15Assembly that the Agency should not take any actions which are 16preempted by federal law or engage in dual regulation of 17nuclear facilities, unless dual regulation is allowed by 18federal law and policies of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 19In implementing its responsibilities under this Act, the 20Agency shall not take any action which interferes with the 21safe operation of a nuclear facility.22(Source: P.A. 103-569, eff. 6-1-24.) 23    (420 ILCS 10/8 new)24    Sec. 8. New nuclear facility construction. The Agency 25shall work with any proposed project, the federal Nuclear   HB4122- 14 -LRB104 15316 AAS 28470 b1Regulatory Commission, and any relevant State agency to reduce 2regulatory barriers to new nuclear facility construction.
