      "abstract": "Amends the Criminal Code of 2012. Creates the offense of failure to report a death. Provides that a person commits the offense when he or she knows or reasonably should know that a person is deceased and fails to report the death to a law enforcement agency within 24 hours after the person's discovery of the death. Provides that a person must report the death of another person to the law enforcement agency of the county where the corpse was found if the person believes that the death was caused by a homicide, accident, or other suspicious circumstance. Provides that a violation is a Class 4 felony. Amends the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963. Provides that, upon verified petition by the State, the court shall hold a hearing and may deny a defendant pretrial release when the defendant is charged with failure to report a death and it is alleged that the defendant's pretrial release poses a real and present threat to the safety of any person or persons or the community, based on the specific articulable facts of the case."
