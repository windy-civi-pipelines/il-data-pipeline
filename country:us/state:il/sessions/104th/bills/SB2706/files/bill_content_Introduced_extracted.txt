Turner SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: 35 ILCS 200/10-60035 ILCS 200/10-720    Amends the Property Tax Code. In provisions concerning the valuation of wind energy devices, provides that, for taxable year 2026 and thereafter, the real property cost basis is $588,000 per megawatt of nameplate capacity (currently, $360,000 per megawatt of nameplate capacity). In provisions concerning the valuation of solar energy systems, provides that, for taxable year 2026 and thereafter, the real property cost basis is $446,000 per megawatt of nameplate capacity (currently, $218,000 per megawatt of nameplate capacity). Effective immediately.LRB104 15663 HLH 28835 b  A BILL FOR SB2706LRB104 15663 HLH 28835 b1    AN ACT concerning revenue. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 5.

For the purposes of this 8Division 18:9    "Wind energy device" means any device, with a nameplate 10capacity of at least 0.5 megawatts, that is used in the process 11of converting kinetic energy from the wind to generate 12electric power for commercial sale.13    "Real 2007 real property cost basis" excludes personal 14property but represents both the land and real property 15improvements of a wind energy device and means: (1) $360,000 16per megawatt of nameplate capacity for taxable years prior to 17taxable year 2026; and (2) $588,000 per megawatt of nameplate 18capacity for taxable year 2026 and thereafter.19    "Trending factor" means a number equal to the consumer 20price index (U.S. city average all items) published by the 21Bureau of Labor Statistics for the December immediately 22preceding the assessment date, divided by the consumer price 23index (U.S. city average all items) published by the Bureau of   SB2706- 2 -LRB104 15663 HLH 28835 b1Labor Statistics for December 2006.2    "Trended real property cost basis" means the 2007 real 3property cost basis multiplied by the trending factor.4    "Allowance for physical depreciation" means (i) the actual 5age in years of the wind energy device on the assessment date 6divided by 25 years multiplied by (ii) the trended real 7property cost basis. The physical depreciation, however, may 8not reduce the value of the wind energy device to less than 30% 9of the trended real property cost basis.10(Source: P.A. 95-644, eff. 10-12-07.) 11    (35 ILCS 200/10-720)12    Sec. 10-720. Definitions. For the purpose of this 13Division 20:14    "Allowance for physical depreciation" means (i) the actual 15age in years of the commercial solar energy system on the 16assessment date divided by 25 years, multiplied by (ii) its 17trended real property cost basis. The physical depreciation, 18however, may not reduce the value of the commercial solar 19energy system to less than 30% of its trended real property 20cost basis. 21    "Commercial solar energy system" means any device or 22assembly of devices that (i) is ground installed and (ii) uses 23solar energy from the sun for generating electricity for the 24primary purpose of wholesale or retail sale and not primarily 25for consumption on the property on which the device or devices   SB2706- 3 -LRB104 15663 HLH 28835 b1reside. 2    "Commercial solar energy system real property cost basis" 3means the owner of a commercial solar energy system's interest 4in the land within the project boundaries and real property 5improvements and shall be calculated at: (1) $218,000 per 6megawatt of nameplate capacity for taxable years prior to 7taxable year 2026; and (2) $446,000 per megawatt of nameplate 8capacity for taxable year 2026 and thereafter. For the 9purposes of this Section, "nameplate capacity" has the same 10definition as found in Section 1-10 of the Illinois Power 11Agency Act. 12    "Ground installed" means the installation of a commercial 13solar energy system, with the primary purpose of solar energy 14generation for wholesale or retail sale, on a parcel or tract 15of land. 16    "Trended real property cost basis" means the commercial 17solar energy system real property cost basis multiplied by the 18trending factor. 19    "Trending factor" means a number equal to the Consumer 20Price Index (U.S. city average all items) published by the 21Bureau of Labor Statistics for the December immediately 22preceding the assessment date, divided by the Consumer Price 23Index (U.S. city average all items) published by the Bureau of 24Labor Statistics for December of 2017. 25(Source: P.A. 100-781, eff. 8-10-18.) 26    Section 99.
