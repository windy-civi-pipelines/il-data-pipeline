Section 1:
Full Text of SR0394 ILGA.GOV SR0394 - 104th General Assembly SR0394LRB104 14115 LAW 27247 r1SENATE RESOLUTION 2    WHEREAS, Ovarian cancer is the fifth-leading cause of 3cancer deaths of women in the United States and causes more 4deaths than any other gynecologic cancer; and 5    WHEREAS, In the United States, a woman's lifetime risk of 6being diagnosed with ovarian cancer is approximately 1 in 78; 7and 8    WHEREAS, The American Cancer Society estimates 20,890 9cases of ovarian cancer will be newly diagnosed in 2025 and 1012,730 individuals will die from the disease nationwide, 11including 770 new cases and 410 deaths in Illinois; and 12    WHEREAS, The five-year survival rate for ovarian cancer is 1350%, although survival rates vary greatly depending on the 14stage of diagnosis, such as individuals who are diagnosed with 15ovarian cancer in its early stages having a survival rate of 16over 90%; and 17    WHEREAS, While a mammogram can detect breast cancer and a 18Pap smear can detect cervical cancer, there is no reliable 19early detection test for ovarian cancer; and 20    WHEREAS, In June 2007, the first national consensus   SR0394- 2 -LRB104 14115 LAW 27247 r1statement on ovarian cancer symptoms was developed to provide 2consistency in describing symptoms to make it easier for women 3to learn and remember those symptoms; and 4    WHEREAS, Black women with ovarian cancer are more likely 5to have late-stage diagnoses, receive lower quality clinical 6services, and have lower five-year survival rates than 7non-Black women; and 8    WHEREAS, Women of color, low-income women, and women 9living in rural areas have more barriers to accessing standard 10quality of care and are more likely to receive care at a 11facility that has poorer adherence to National Comprehensive 12Cancer Network (NCCN) treatment guidelines; and 13    WHEREAS, Too many people remain unaware that the symptoms 14of ovarian cancer often include bloating, pelvic or abdominal 15pain, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, urinary 16symptoms, and several other vague symptoms that are often 17easily confused with other diseases; and 18    WHEREAS, Improved awareness of the symptoms of ovarian 19cancer by the public and health care providers can lead to a 20quicker diagnosis; and 21    WHEREAS, The lack of an early detection test for ovarian   SR0394- 3 -LRB104 14115 LAW 27247 r1cancer combined with its vague symptoms mean that 2approximately 80% of ovarian cancer cases are detected at an 3advanced stage; and 4    WHEREAS, Persistent issues in collecting and reporting 5data related to ovarian cancer risk, treatment, and outcomes 6are particularly pronounced and impede the development of 7effective policy; and 8    WHEREAS, All women are at risk for ovarian cancer, but 9approximately 20% of women who are diagnosed with ovarian 10cancer have a hereditary predisposition to ovarian cancer, 11which places them at even higher risk; and 12    WHEREAS, Scientists and physicians have uncovered changes 13in the BRCA genes that some women inherit from their parents, 14which may make those women 30 times more likely to develop 15ovarian cancer; and 16    WHEREAS, A woman's family history has been found to play 17an important role in accurately assessing their risk of 18developing ovarian cancer, and medical experts believe that 19family history should be taken into consideration during the 20annual well-woman visit of any woman; and 21    WHEREAS, Women who know that they are at high risk of   SR0394- 4 -LRB104 14115 LAW 27247 r1ovarian cancer may undertake prophylactic measures, such as 2opportunistic salpingectomy, to help reduce the risk of 3developing this disease; and 4    WHEREAS, Guidelines issued by the National Comprehensive 5Cancer Network and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 6recommend that all individuals diagnosed with ovarian cancer 7receive genetic counseling and genetic testing regardless of 8family history; and 9    WHEREAS, Studies consistently show that compliance with 10these guidelines is alarmingly low, with recently published 11National Cancer Institute-funded research finding that in 2013 12and 2014, only one-third of ovarian cancer survivors have 13undergone such testing; and 14    WHEREAS, According to a 2016 consensus report by the 15National Academy of Medicine, "there remain surprising gaps in 16the fundamental knowledge about and understanding of ovarian 17cancer" across all aspects of the disease; and 18    WHEREAS, Ongoing investments in ovarian cancer research 19and education and awareness efforts are critical to closing 20these gaps and improving survivorship for women with ovarian 21cancer; and   SR0394- 5 -LRB104 14115 LAW 27247 r1    WHEREAS, Each year during the month of September, the 2Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance (OCRA) and community partner 3organizations hold a number of events to increase public 4awareness of ovarian cancer and its symptoms; and 5    WHEREAS, National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month is 6typically recognized during the month of September each year; 7therefore, be it 8    RESOLVED, BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTH GENERAL 9ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, that we declare September 102025 as Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month in the State of 11Illinois to increase public awareness of ovarian cancer; and 12be it further 13    RESOLVED, That we affirm our support towards the goals and 14ideals of National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month.
