Microbeads and glitter in personal care 8products; prohibited Microbead-free waters.9    (a) As used in this Section:10    "Nonbiodegradable plastic glitter" means a decorative 11material, consisting of reflective particles of one or more 12colors that are less than 2 millimeters in size, made of 13nonbiodegradable plastic, precision-cut into various shapes 14and sizes, and introduced into products to create a shimmering 15effect by reflecting light.16    "Over the counter drug" means a drug that is a personal 17care product that contains a label that identifies the product 18as a drug as required by 21 CFR 201.66. An "over the counter 19drug" label includes:20        (1) A drug facts panel; or21        (2) A statement of the active ingredients with a list 22    of those ingredients contained in the compound, substance, 23    or preparation.  HB4175- 2 -LRB104 15732 BDA 28916 b1    "Personal care product" means any article intended to be 2rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or 3otherwise applied to the human body or any part thereof for 4cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering 5the appearance, and any article intended for use as a 6component of any such article. "Personal care product" does 7not include any prescription drugs.8    "Plastic" means a synthetic material made from linking 9monomers through a chemical reaction to create an organic 10polymer chain that can be molded or extruded at high heat into 11various solid forms retaining their defined shapes during life 12cycle and after disposal.13    "Synthetic plastic microbead" means any intentionally 14added non-biodegradable solid plastic particle measured less 15than 5 millimeters in size and is used to exfoliate or cleanse 16in a rinse-off product.17    (b) The General Assembly hereby finds that microbeads, a 18synthetic alternative ingredient to such natural materials as 19ground almonds, oatmeal, and pumice, found in over 100 20personal care products, including facial cleansers, shampoos, 21and toothpastes, pose a serious threat to the State's 22environment.23    Microbeads have been documented to collect harmful 24pollutants already present in the environment and harm fish 25and other aquatic organisms that form the base of the aquatic 26food chain. Recently, microbeads have been recorded in   HB4175- 3 -LRB104 15732 BDA 28916 b1Illinois water bodies, and in particular, the waters of Lake 2Michigan.3    Although synthetic plastic microbeads are a safe and 4effective mild abrasive ingredient effectively used for gently 5removing dead skin, there are recent concerns about the 6potential environmental impact of these materials. More 7research is needed on any adverse consequences, but a number 8of cosmetic manufacturers have already begun a voluntary 9process for identifying alternatives that allay those 10concerns. Those alternatives will be carefully evaluated to 11assure safety and implemented in a timely manner.12    Without significant and costly improvements to the 13majority of the State's sewage treatment facilities, 14microbeads contained in products will continue to pollute 15Illinois' waters and hinder the recent substantial economic 16investments in redeveloping Illinois waterfronts and the 17ongoing efforts to restore the State's lakes and rivers and 18recreational and commercial fisheries.19    (c) Effective December 31, 2017, no person shall 20manufacture for sale a personal care product, except for an 21over the counter drug, that contains synthetic plastic 22microbeads as defined in this Section.23    (d) Effective December 31, 2018, no person shall accept 24for sale a personal care product, except for an over the 25counter drug, that contains synthetic plastic microbeads as 26defined in this Section.  HB4175- 4 -LRB104 15732 BDA 28916 b1    (e) Effective December 31, 2018, no person shall 2manufacture for sale an over the counter drug that contains 3synthetic plastic microbeads as defined in this Section.4    (f) Effective December 31, 2019, no person shall accept 5for sale an over the counter drug that contains synthetic 6plastic microbeads as defined in this Section.7    (g) Effective December 31, 2029, no person shall 8manufacture or accept for sale a personal care product that 9contains nonbiodegradable plastic glitter; however, until 10December 31, 2030, a person may continue to accept for sale an 11existing stock of personal care products containing 12nonbiodegradable plastic glitter that was acquired and 13transported into the State before December 31, 2029.14(Source: P.A. 98-638, eff. 1-1-15.) 15    Section 99.
