The Court may deny or 17    grant the request for continuance. If the court decides to 18    grant the continuance, the Court retains the discretion to 19    detain or release the defendant in the time between the 20    filing of the petition and the hearing.21    (d) Contents of petition.22        (1) The petition shall be verified by the State and 23    shall state the grounds upon which it contends the 24    defendant should be denied pretrial release, including the 25    real and present threat to the safety of any person or 26    persons or the community, based on the specific   HB4126- 11 -LRB104 14618 RLC 27760 b1    articulable facts or flight risk, as appropriate.2        (2) If the State seeks to file a second or subsequent 3    petition under this Section, the State shall be required 4    to present a verified application setting forth in detail 5    any new facts not known or obtainable at the time of the 6    filing of the previous petition.7    (e) Eligibility: All defendants shall be presumed eligible 8for pretrial release, and the State shall bear the burden of 9proving by clear and convincing evidence that:10        (1) the proof is evident or the presumption great that 11    the defendant has committed an offense listed in 12    subsection (a), and13        (2) for offenses listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) 14    of subsection (a), the defendant poses a real and present 15    threat to the safety of any person or persons or the 16    community, based on the specific articulable facts of the 17    case, by conduct which may include, but is not limited to, 18    a forcible felony, the obstruction of justice, 19    intimidation, injury, or abuse as defined by paragraph (1) 20    of Section 103 of the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 21    1986, and22        (3) no condition or combination of conditions set 23    forth in subsection (b) of Section 110-10 of this Article 24    can mitigate (i) the real and present threat to the safety 25    of any person or persons or the community, based on the 26    specific articulable facts of the case, for offenses   HB4126- 12 -LRB104 14618 RLC 27760 b1    listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) of subsection (a), or 2    (ii) the defendant's willful flight for offenses listed in 3    paragraph (8) of subsection (a), and4        (4) for offenses under subsection (b) of Section 407 5    of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act that are subject 6    to paragraph (1) of subsection (a), no condition or 7    combination of conditions set forth in subsection (b) of 8    Section 110-10 of this Article can mitigate the real and 9    present threat to the safety of any person or persons or 10    the community, based on the specific articulable facts of 11    the case, and the defendant poses a serious risk to not 12    appear in court as required.13    (f) Conduct of the hearings.14        (1) Prior to the hearing, the State shall tender to 15    the defendant copies of the defendant's criminal history 16    available, any written or recorded statements, and the 17    substance of any oral statements made by any person, if 18    relied upon by the State in its petition, and any police 19    reports in the prosecutor's possession at the time of the 20    hearing.21        (2) The State or defendant may present evidence at the 22    hearing by way of proffer based upon reliable information.23        (3) The defendant has the right to be represented by 24    counsel, and if he or she is indigent, to have counsel 25    appointed for him or her. The defendant shall have the 26    opportunity to testify, to present witnesses on his or her   HB4126- 13 -LRB104 14618 RLC 27760 b1    own behalf, and to cross-examine any witnesses that are 2    called by the State. Defense counsel shall be given 3    adequate opportunity to confer with the defendant before 4    any hearing at which conditions of release or the 5    detention of the defendant are to be considered, with an 6    accommodation for a physical condition made to facilitate 7    attorney/client consultation. If defense counsel needs to 8    confer or consult with the defendant during any hearing 9    conducted via a 2-way two-way audio-visual communication 10    system, such consultation shall not be recorded and shall 11    be undertaken consistent with constitutional protections. 12        (3.5) A hearing at which pretrial release may be 13    denied must be conducted in person (and not by way of 2-way 14    two-way audio visual communication) unless the accused 15    waives the right to be present physically in court, the 16    court determines that the physical health and safety of 17    any person necessary to the proceedings would be 18    endangered by appearing in court, or the chief judge of 19    the circuit orders use of that system due to operational 20    challenges in conducting the hearing in person. Such 21    operational challenges must be documented and approved by 22    the chief judge of the circuit, and a plan to address the 23    challenges through reasonable efforts must be presented 24    and approved by the Administrative Office of the Illinois 25    Courts every 6 months. 26        (4) If the defense seeks to compel the complaining   HB4126- 14 -LRB104 14618 RLC 27760 b1    witness to testify as a witness in its favor, it shall 2    petition the court for permission. When the ends of 3    justice so require, the court may exercise its discretion 4    and compel the appearance of a complaining witness. The 5    court shall state on the record reasons for granting a 6    defense request to compel the presence of a complaining 7    witness only on the issue of the defendant's pretrial 8    detention. In making a determination under this Section, 9    the court shall state on the record the reason for 10    granting a defense request to compel the presence of a 11    complaining witness, and only grant the request if the 12    court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the 13    defendant will be materially prejudiced if the complaining 14    witness does not appear. Cross-examination of a 15    complaining witness at the pretrial detention hearing for 16    the purpose of impeaching the witness' credibility is 17    insufficient reason to compel the presence of the witness. 18    In deciding whether to compel the appearance of a 19    complaining witness, the court shall be considerate of the 20    emotional and physical well-being of the witness. The 21    pre-trial detention hearing is not to be used for purposes 22    of discovery, and the post arraignment rules of discovery 23    do not apply. The State shall tender to the defendant, 24    prior to the hearing, copies, if any, of the defendant's 25    criminal history, if available, and any written or 26    recorded statements and the substance of any oral   HB4126- 15 -LRB104 14618 RLC 27760 b1    statements made by any person, if in the State's 2    Attorney's possession at the time of the hearing. 3        (5) The rules concerning the admissibility of evidence 4    in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and 5    consideration of information at the hearing. At the trial 6    concerning the offense for which the hearing was conducted 7    neither the finding of the court nor any transcript or 8    other record of the hearing shall be admissible in the 9    State's case-in-chief, but shall be admissible for 10    impeachment, or as provided in Section 115-10.1 of this 11    Code, or in a perjury proceeding.12        (6) The defendant may not move to suppress evidence or 13    a confession, however, evidence that proof of the charged 14    crime may have been the result of an unlawful search or 15    seizure, or both, or through improper interrogation, is 16    relevant in assessing the weight of the evidence against 17    the defendant.18        (7) Decisions regarding release, conditions of 19    release, and detention prior to trial must be 20    individualized, and no single factor or standard may be 21    used exclusively to order detention. Risk assessment tools 22    may not be used as the sole basis to deny pretrial release. 23    (g) Factors to be considered in making a determination of 24dangerousness. The court may, in determining whether the 25defendant poses a real and present threat to the safety of any 26person or persons or the community, based on the specific   HB4126- 16 -LRB104 14618 RLC 27760 b1articulable facts of the case, consider, but shall not be 2limited to, evidence or testimony concerning:3        (1) The nature and circumstances of any offense 4    charged, including whether the offense is a crime of 5    violence, involving a weapon, or a sex offense.6        (2) The history and characteristics of the defendant 7    including:8            (A) Any evidence of the defendant's prior criminal 9        history indicative of violent, abusive, or assaultive 10        behavior, or lack of such behavior. Such evidence may 11        include testimony or documents received in juvenile 12        proceedings, criminal, quasi-criminal, civil 13        commitment, domestic relations, or other proceedings.14            (B) Any evidence of the defendant's psychological, 15        psychiatric or other similar social history which 16        tends to indicate a violent, abusive, or assaultive 17        nature, or lack of any such history.18        (3) The identity of any person or persons to whose 19    safety the defendant is believed to pose a threat, and the 20    nature of the threat.21        (4) Any statements made by, or attributed to the 22    defendant, together with the circumstances surrounding 23    them.24        (5) The age and physical condition of the defendant.25        (6) The age and physical condition of any victim or 26    complaining witness.   HB4126- 17 -LRB104 14618 RLC 27760 b1        (7) Whether the defendant is known to possess or have 2    access to any weapon or weapons.3        (8) Whether, at the time of the current offense or any 4    other offense or arrest, the defendant was on probation, 5    parole, aftercare release, mandatory supervised release, 6    or other release from custody pending trial, sentencing, 7    appeal, or completion of sentence for an offense under 8    federal or State state law.9        (9) Any other factors, including those listed in 10    Section 110-5 of this Article deemed by the court to have a 11    reasonable bearing upon the defendant's propensity or 12    reputation for violent, abusive, or assaultive behavior, 13    or lack of such behavior.14    (h) Detention order. The court shall, in any order for 15detention:16        (1) make a written finding summarizing the court's 17    reasons for concluding that the defendant should be denied 18    pretrial release, including why less restrictive 19    conditions would not avoid a real and present threat to 20    the safety of any person or persons or the community, 21    based on the specific articulable facts of the case, or 22    prevent the defendant's willful flight from prosecution;23        (2) direct that the defendant be committed to the 24    custody of the sheriff for confinement in the county jail 25    pending trial;26        (3) direct that the defendant be given a reasonable   HB4126- 18 -LRB104 14618 RLC 27760 b1    opportunity for private consultation with counsel, and for 2    communication with others of his or her choice by 3    visitation, mail and telephone; and4        (4) direct that the sheriff deliver the defendant as 5    required for appearances in connection with court 6    proceedings.7    (i) Detention. If the court enters an order for the 8detention of the defendant pursuant to subsection (e) of this 9Section, the defendant shall be brought to trial on the 10offense for which he is detained within 90 days after the date 11on which the order for detention was entered. If the defendant 12is not brought to trial within the 90-day period required by 13the preceding sentence, he shall not be denied pretrial 14release. In computing the 90-day period, the court shall omit 15any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted at 16the request of the defendant and any period of delay resulting 17from a continuance granted at the request of the State with 18good cause shown pursuant to Section 103-5.19    (i-5) At each subsequent appearance of the defendant 20before the court, the judge must find that continued detention 21is necessary to avoid a real and present threat to the safety 22of any person or persons or the community, based on the 23specific articulable facts of the case, or to prevent the 24defendant's willful flight from prosecution. 25    (j) Rights of the defendant. The defendant shall be 26entitled to appeal any order entered under this Section   HB4126- 19 -LRB104 14618 RLC 27760 b1denying his or her pretrial release.2    (k) Appeal.

The Court may deny or 17    grant the request for continuance. If the court decides to 18    grant the continuance, the Court retains the discretion to 19    detain or release the defendant in the time between the 20    filing of the petition and the hearing.21    (d) Contents of petition.22        (1) The petition shall be verified by the State and 23    shall state the grounds upon which it contends the 24    defendant should be denied pretrial release, including the 25    real and present threat to the safety of any person or 26    persons or the community, based on the specific   HB4126- 11 -LRB104 14618 RLC 27760 b1    articulable facts or flight risk, as appropriate.2        (2) If the State seeks to file a second or subsequent 3    petition under this Section, the State shall be required 4    to present a verified application setting forth in detail 5    any new facts not known or obtainable at the time of the 6    filing of the previous petition.7    (e) Eligibility: All defendants shall be presumed eligible 8for pretrial release, and the State shall bear the burden of 9proving by clear and convincing evidence that:10        (1) the proof is evident or the presumption great that 11    the defendant has committed an offense listed in 12    subsection (a), and13        (2) for offenses listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) 14    of subsection (a), the defendant poses a real and present 15    threat to the safety of any person or persons or the 16    community, based on the specific articulable facts of the 17    case, by conduct which may include, but is not limited to, 18    a forcible felony, the obstruction of justice, 19    intimidation, injury, or abuse as defined by paragraph (1) 20    of Section 103 of the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 21    1986, and22        (3) no condition or combination of conditions set 23    forth in subsection (b) of Section 110-10 of this Article 24    can mitigate (i) the real and present threat to the safety 25    of any person or persons or the community, based on the 26    specific articulable facts of the case, for offenses   HB4126- 12 -LRB104 14618 RLC 27760 b1    listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) of subsection (a), or 2    (ii) the defendant's willful flight for offenses listed in 3    paragraph (8) of subsection (a), and4        (4) for offenses under subsection (b) of Section 407 5    of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act that are subject 6    to paragraph (1) of subsection (a), no condition or 7    combination of conditions set forth in subsection (b) of 8    Section 110-10 of this Article can mitigate the real and 9    present threat to the safety of any person or persons or 10    the community, based on the specific articulable facts of 11    the case, and the defendant poses a serious risk to not 12    appear in court as required.13    (f) Conduct of the hearings.14        (1) Prior to the hearing, the State shall tender to 15    the defendant copies of the defendant's criminal history 16    available, any written or recorded statements, and the 17    substance of any oral statements made by any person, if 18    relied upon by the State in its petition, and any police 19    reports in the prosecutor's possession at the time of the 20    hearing.21        (2) The State or defendant may present evidence at the 22    hearing by way of proffer based upon reliable information.23        (3) The defendant has the right to be represented by 24    counsel, and if he or she is indigent, to have counsel 25    appointed for him or her. The defendant shall have the 26    opportunity to testify, to present witnesses on his or her   HB4126- 13 -LRB104 14618 RLC 27760 b1    own behalf, and to cross-examine any witnesses that are 2    called by the State. Defense counsel shall be given 3    adequate opportunity to confer with the defendant before 4    any hearing at which conditions of release or the 5    detention of the defendant are to be considered, with an 6    accommodation for a physical condition made to facilitate 7    attorney/client consultation. If defense counsel needs to 8    confer or consult with the defendant during any hearing 9    conducted via a 2-way two-way audio-visual communication 10    system, such consultation shall not be recorded and shall 11    be undertaken consistent with constitutional protections. 12        (3.5) A hearing at which pretrial release may be 13    denied must be conducted in person (and not by way of 2-way 14    two-way audio visual communication) unless the accused 15    waives the right to be present physically in court, the 16    court determines that the physical health and safety of 17    any person necessary to the proceedings would be 18    endangered by appearing in court, or the chief judge of 19    the circuit orders use of that system due to operational 20    challenges in conducting the hearing in person. Such 21    operational challenges must be documented and approved by 22    the chief judge of the circuit, and a plan to address the 23    challenges through reasonable efforts must be presented 24    and approved by the Administrative Office of the Illinois 25    Courts every 6 months. 26        (4) If the defense seeks to compel the complaining   HB4126- 14 -LRB104 14618 RLC 27760 b1    witness to testify as a witness in its favor, it shall 2    petition the court for permission. When the ends of 3    justice so require, the court may exercise its discretion 4    and compel the appearance of a complaining witness. The 5    court shall state on the record reasons for granting a 6    defense request to compel the presence of a complaining 7    witness only on the issue of the defendant's pretrial 8    detention. In making a determination under this Section, 9    the court shall state on the record the reason for 10    granting a defense request to compel the presence of a 11    complaining witness, and only grant the request if the 12    court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the 13    defendant will be materially prejudiced if the complaining 14    witness does not appear. Cross-examination of a 15    complaining witness at the pretrial detention hearing for 16    the purpose of impeaching the witness' credibility is 17    insufficient reason to compel the presence of the witness. 18    In deciding whether to compel the appearance of a 19    complaining witness, the court shall be considerate of the 20    emotional and physical well-being of the witness. The 21    pre-trial detention hearing is not to be used for purposes 22    of discovery, and the post arraignment rules of discovery 23    do not apply. The State shall tender to the defendant, 24    prior to the hearing, copies, if any, of the defendant's 25    criminal history, if available, and any written or 26    recorded statements and the substance of any oral   HB4126- 15 -LRB104 14618 RLC 27760 b1    statements made by any person, if in the State's 2    Attorney's possession at the time of the hearing. 3        (5) The rules concerning the admissibility of evidence 4    in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and 5    consideration of information at the hearing. At the trial 6    concerning the offense for which the hearing was conducted 7    neither the finding of the court nor any transcript or 8    other record of the hearing shall be admissible in the 9    State's case-in-chief, but shall be admissible for 10    impeachment, or as provided in Section 115-10.1 of this 11    Code, or in a perjury proceeding.12        (6) The defendant may not move to suppress evidence or 13    a confession, however, evidence that proof of the charged 14    crime may have been the result of an unlawful search or 15    seizure, or both, or through improper interrogation, is 16    relevant in assessing the weight of the evidence against 17    the defendant.18        (7) Decisions regarding release, conditions of 19    release, and detention prior to trial must be 20    individualized, and no single factor or standard may be 21    used exclusively to order detention. Risk assessment tools 22    may not be used as the sole basis to deny pretrial release. 23    (g) Factors to be considered in making a determination of 24dangerousness. The court may, in determining whether the 25defendant poses a real and present threat to the safety of any 26person or persons or the community, based on the specific   HB4126- 16 -LRB104 14618 RLC 27760 b1articulable facts of the case, consider, but shall not be 2limited to, evidence or testimony concerning:3        (1) The nature and circumstances of any offense 4    charged, including whether the offense is a crime of 5    violence, involving a weapon, or a sex offense.6        (2) The history and characteristics of the defendant 7    including:8            (A) Any evidence of the defendant's prior criminal 9        history indicative of violent, abusive, or assaultive 10        behavior, or lack of such behavior. Such evidence may 11        include testimony or documents received in juvenile 12        proceedings, criminal, quasi-criminal, civil 13        commitment, domestic relations, or other proceedings.14            (B) Any evidence of the defendant's psychological, 15        psychiatric or other similar social history which 16        tends to indicate a violent, abusive, or assaultive 17        nature, or lack of any such history.18        (3) The identity of any person or persons to whose 19    safety the defendant is believed to pose a threat, and the 20    nature of the threat.21        (4) Any statements made by, or attributed to the 22    defendant, together with the circumstances surrounding 23    them.24        (5) The age and physical condition of the defendant.25        (6) The age and physical condition of any victim or 26    complaining witness.   HB4126- 17 -LRB104 14618 RLC 27760 b1        (7) Whether the defendant is known to possess or have 2    access to any weapon or weapons.3        (8) Whether, at the time of the current offense or any 4    other offense or arrest, the defendant was on probation, 5    parole, aftercare release, mandatory supervised release, 6    or other release from custody pending trial, sentencing, 7    appeal, or completion of sentence for an offense under 8    federal or State state law.9        (9) Any other factors, including those listed in 10    Section 110-5 of this Article deemed by the court to have a 11    reasonable bearing upon the defendant's propensity or 12    reputation for violent, abusive, or assaultive behavior, 13    or lack of such behavior.14    (h) Detention order. The court shall, in any order for 15detention:16        (1) make a written finding summarizing the court's 17    reasons for concluding that the defendant should be denied 18    pretrial release, including why less restrictive 19    conditions would not avoid a real and present threat to 20    the safety of any person or persons or the community, 21    based on the specific articulable facts of the case, or 22    prevent the defendant's willful flight from prosecution;23        (2) direct that the defendant be committed to the 24    custody of the sheriff for confinement in the county jail 25    pending trial;26        (3) direct that the defendant be given a reasonable   HB4126- 18 -LRB104 14618 RLC 27760 b1    opportunity for private consultation with counsel, and for 2    communication with others of his or her choice by 3    visitation, mail and telephone; and4        (4) direct that the sheriff deliver the defendant as 5    required for appearances in connection with court 6    proceedings.7    (i) Detention. If the court enters an order for the 8detention of the defendant pursuant to subsection (e) of this 9Section, the defendant shall be brought to trial on the 10offense for which he is detained within 90 days after the date 11on which the order for detention was entered. If the defendant 12is not brought to trial within the 90-day period required by 13the preceding sentence, he shall not be denied pretrial 14release. In computing the 90-day period, the court shall omit 15any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted at 16the request of the defendant and any period of delay resulting 17from a continuance granted at the request of the State with 18good cause shown pursuant to Section 103-5.19    (i-5) At each subsequent appearance of the defendant 20before the court, the judge must find that continued detention 21is necessary to avoid a real and present threat to the safety 22of any person or persons or the community, based on the 23specific articulable facts of the case, or to prevent the 24defendant's willful flight from prosecution. 25    (j) Rights of the defendant. The defendant shall be 26entitled to appeal any order entered under this Section   HB4126- 19 -LRB104 14618 RLC 27760 b1denying his or her pretrial release.2    (k) Appeal.
