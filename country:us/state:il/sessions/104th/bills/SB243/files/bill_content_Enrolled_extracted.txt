Failure to comply with a written request, extend the time 17for response, or deny a request within 5 business days after 18its receipt shall be considered a denial of the request. A 19public body that fails to respond to a request within the 20requisite periods in this Section but thereafter provides the 21requester with copies of the requested public records may not 22impose a fee for such copies. A public body that fails to 23respond to a request received may not treat the request as 24unduly burdensome under subsection (g). 25    (e) The time for response under this Section may be 26extended by the public body for not more than 5 business days   SB0243 Enrolled- 31 -LRB104 07181 BDA 17218 b1from the original due date for any of the following reasons:2        (i) the requested records are stored in whole or in 3    part at other locations than the office having charge of 4    the requested records;5        (ii) the request requires the collection of a 6    substantial number of specified records;7        (iii) the request is couched in categorical terms and 8    requires an extensive search for the records responsive to 9    it;10        (iv) the requested records have not been located in 11    the course of routine search and additional efforts are 12    being made to locate them;13        (v) the requested records require examination and 14    evaluation by personnel having the necessary competence 15    and discretion to determine if they are exempt from 16    disclosure under Section 7 of this Act or should be 17    revealed only with appropriate deletions;18        (vi) the request for records cannot be complied with 19    by the public body within the time limits prescribed by 20    subsection (d) of this Section without unduly burdening or 21    interfering with the operations of the public body;22        (vii) there is a need for consultation, which shall be 23    conducted with all practicable speed, with another public 24    body or among 2 or more components of a public body having 25    a substantial interest in the determination or in the 26    subject matter of the request.  SB0243 Enrolled- 32 -LRB104 07181 BDA 17218 b1    The person making a request and the public body may agree 2in writing to extend the time for compliance for a period to be 3determined by the parties. If the requester and the public 4body agree to extend the period for compliance, a failure by 5the public body to comply with any previous deadlines shall 6not be treated as a denial of the request for the records. 7    (f) When additional time is required for any of the above 8reasons, the public body shall, within 5 business days after 9receipt of the request, notify the person making the request 10of the reasons for the extension and the date by which the 11response will be forthcoming. Failure to respond within the 12time permitted for extension shall be considered a denial of 13the request. A public body that fails to respond to a request 14within the time permitted for extension but thereafter 15provides the requester with copies of the requested public 16records may not impose a fee for those copies. A public body 17that requests an extension and subsequently fails to respond 18to the request may not treat the request as unduly burdensome 19under subsection (g).20    (g) Requests calling for all records falling within a 21category shall be complied with unless compliance with the 22request would be unduly burdensome for the complying public 23body and there is no way to narrow the request and the burden 24on the public body outweighs the public interest in the 25information. Before invoking this exemption, the public body 26shall extend to the person making the request an opportunity   SB0243 Enrolled- 33 -LRB104 07181 BDA 17218 b1to confer with it in an attempt to reduce the request to 2manageable proportions. If any public body responds to a 3categorical request by stating that compliance would unduly 4burden its operation and the conditions described above are 5met, it shall do so in writing, specifying the reasons why it 6would be unduly burdensome and the extent to which compliance 7will so burden the operations of the public body. Such a 8response shall be treated as a denial of the request for 9information. 10    Repeated requests from the same person for the same 11records that are unchanged or identical to records previously 12provided or properly denied under this Act shall be deemed 13unduly burdensome under this provision.14    (h) Each public body may promulgate rules and regulations 15in conformity with the provisions of this Section pertaining 16to the availability of records and procedures to be followed, 17including:18        (i) the times and places where such records will be 19    made available, and20        (ii) the persons from whom such records may be 21    obtained.22    (i) The time periods for compliance or denial of a request 23to inspect or copy records set out in this Section shall not 24apply to requests for records made for a commercial purpose, 25requests by a recurrent requester, or voluminous requests. 26Such requests shall be subject to the provisions of Sections   SB0243 Enrolled- 34 -LRB104 07181 BDA 17218 b13.1, 3.2, and 3.6 of this Act, as applicable. 2    (j) Within 5 business days after its receipt of the 3request, a public body that has a reasonable belief that a 4request was not submitted by a person may require the 5requester to verify orally or in writing that the requester is 6a person. The deadline for the public body to respond to the 7request shall be tolled until the requester verifies that he 8or she is a person. If the requester fails to verify that he or 9she is a person within 30 days after the public body requests 10such a verification, then the public body may deny the 11request. For purposes of this subsection (j), a public body 12may not require the requester to submit personal information, 13private information, or identifying information to verify that 14the requester is a person.15(Source: P.A. 101-81, eff. 7-12-19.) 16    (5 ILCS 140/4)  (from Ch. 116, par. 204)17    Sec. 4.

"Unwarranted 19    invasion of personal privacy" means the disclosure of 20    information that is highly personal or objectionable to a 21    reasonable person and in which the subject's right to 22    privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in 23    obtaining the information.

Failure to comply with a written request, extend the time 17for response, or deny a request within 5 business days after 18its receipt shall be considered a denial of the request. A 19public body that fails to respond to a request within the 20requisite periods in this Section but thereafter provides the 21requester with copies of the requested public records may not 22impose a fee for such copies.

If the requester and the public 4body agree to extend the period for compliance, a failure by 5the public body to comply with any previous deadlines shall 6not be treated as a denial of the request for the records. 7    (f) When additional time is required for any of the above 8reasons, the public body shall, within 5 business days after 9receipt of the request, notify the person making the request 10of the reasons for the extension and the date by which the 11response will be forthcoming.

A public body that fails to respond to a request 14within the time permitted for extension but thereafter 15provides the requester with copies of the requested public 16records may not impose a fee for those copies. A public body 17that requests an extension and subsequently fails to respond 18to the request may not treat the request as unduly burdensome 19under subsection (g).20    (g) Requests calling for all records falling within a 21category shall be complied with unless compliance with the 22request would be unduly burdensome for the complying public 23body and there is no way to narrow the request and the burden 24on the public body outweighs the public interest in the 25information. Before invoking this exemption, the public body 26shall extend to the person making the request an opportunity   SB0243 Enrolled- 33 -LRB104 07181 BDA 17218 b1to confer with it in an attempt to reduce the request to 2manageable proportions. If any public body responds to a 3categorical request by stating that compliance would unduly 4burden its operation and the conditions described above are 5met, it shall do so in writing, specifying the reasons why it 6would be unduly burdensome and the extent to which compliance 7will so burden the operations of the public body. Such a 8response shall be treated as a denial of the request for 9information. 10    Repeated requests from the same person for the same 11records that are unchanged or identical to records previously 12provided or properly denied under this Act shall be deemed 13unduly burdensome under this provision.14    (h) Each public body may promulgate rules and regulations 15in conformity with the provisions of this Section pertaining 16to the availability of records and procedures to be followed, 17including:18        (i) the times and places where such records will be 19    made available, and20        (ii) the persons from whom such records may be 21    obtained.22    (i) The time periods for compliance or denial of a request 23to inspect or copy records set out in this Section shall not 24apply to requests for records made for a commercial purpose, 25requests by a recurrent requester, or voluminous requests. 26Such requests shall be subject to the provisions of Sections   SB0243 Enrolled- 34 -LRB104 07181 BDA 17218 b13.1, 3.2, and 3.6 of this Act, as applicable. 2    (j) Within 5 business days after its receipt of the 3request, a public body that has a reasonable belief that a 4request was not submitted by a person may require the 5requester to verify orally or in writing that the requester is 6a person. The deadline for the public body to respond to the 7request shall be tolled until the requester verifies that he 8or she is a person. If the requester fails to verify that he or 9she is a person within 30 days after the public body requests 10such a verification, then the public body may deny the 11request. For purposes of this subsection (j), a public body 12may not require the requester to submit personal information, 13private information, or identifying information to verify that 14the requester is a person.15(Source: P.A. 101-81, eff. 7-12-19.) 16    (5 ILCS 140/4)  (from Ch. 116, par. 204)17    Sec. 4.
