Provides that the purpose of the study shall be to evaluate the impact of guardian ad litem appointments on litigants, with particular focus on low-income families, and to identify whether current practices promote fairness, access to justice, and the best interests of children. Requires that the Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts submit a final report to the General Assembly and the Governor no later than December 31, 2026. Requires that the report shall include findings, analysis, and recommendations, including potential statutory language to update Illinois law governing guardian ad litem appointments, costs, and funding structures. Repeals the new provisions on January 1, 2028."
