If there is a finding of no 11probable cause, the defendant shall be released.

The Court may deny or 4    grant the request for continuance. If the court decides to 5    grant the continuance, the Court retains the discretion to 6    detain or release the defendant in the time between the 7    filing of the petition and the hearing.8    (d) Contents of petition.9        (1) The petition shall be verified by the State and 10    shall state the grounds upon which it contends the 11    defendant should be denied pretrial release, including the 12    real and present threat to the safety of any person or 13    persons or the community, based on the specific 14    articulable facts or flight risk, as appropriate.15        (2) If the State seeks to file a second or subsequent 16    petition under this Section, the State shall be required 17    to present a verified application setting forth in detail 18    any new facts not known or obtainable at the time of the 19    filing of the previous petition.20    (e) Eligibility: All defendants shall be presumed eligible 21for pretrial release, and the State shall bear the burden of 22proving by clear and convincing evidence that:23        (1) the proof is evident or the presumption great that 24    the defendant has committed an offense listed in 25    subsection (a), and26        (2) for offenses listed in paragraphs (1) through (7)   SB2705- 9 -LRB104 15520 RLC 28684 b1    of subsection (a), the defendant poses a real and present 2    threat to the safety of any person or persons or the 3    community, based on the specific articulable facts of the 4    case, by conduct which may include, but is not limited to, 5    a forcible felony, the obstruction of justice, 6    intimidation, injury, or abuse as defined by paragraph (1) 7    of Section 103 of the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 8    1986, and9        (3) if within the court's discretion, no condition or 10    combination of conditions set forth in subsection (b) of 11    Section 110-10 of this Article can materially mitigate (i) 12    the real and present threat to the safety of any person or 13    persons or the community, based on the specific 14    articulable facts of the case, for offenses listed in 15    paragraphs (1) through (7) of subsection (a), or (ii) the 16    defendant's willful flight for offenses listed in 17    paragraph (8) of subsection (a), and18        (4) for offenses under subsection (b) of Section 407 19    of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act that are subject 20    to paragraph (1) of subsection (a), no condition or 21    combination of conditions set forth in subsection (b) of 22    Section 110-10 of this Article can mitigate the real and 23    present threat to the safety of any person or persons or 24    the community, based on the specific articulable facts of 25    the case, and the defendant poses a serious risk to not 26    appear in court as required.  SB2705- 10 -LRB104 15520 RLC 28684 b1    (f) Conduct of the hearings.2        (1) Prior to the hearing, the State shall tender to 3    the defendant copies of the defendant's criminal history 4    available, any written or recorded statements, and the 5    substance of any oral statements made by any person, if 6    relied upon by the State in its petition, and any police 7    reports in the prosecutor's possession at the time of the 8    hearing.9        (2) The State or defendant may present evidence at the 10    hearing by way of proffer based upon reliable information.11        (3) The defendant has the right to be represented by 12    counsel, and if he or she is indigent, to have counsel 13    appointed for him or her. The defendant shall have the 14    opportunity to testify, to present witnesses on his or her 15    own behalf, and to cross-examine any witnesses that are 16    called by the State. Defense counsel shall be given 17    adequate opportunity to confer with the defendant before 18    any hearing at which conditions of release or the 19    detention of the defendant are to be considered, with an 20    accommodation for a physical condition made to facilitate 21    attorney/client consultation. If defense counsel needs to 22    confer or consult with the defendant during any hearing 23    conducted via a 2-way two-way audio-visual communication 24    system, such consultation shall not be recorded and shall 25    be undertaken consistent with constitutional protections. 26        (3.5) A hearing at which pretrial release may be   SB2705- 11 -LRB104 15520 RLC 28684 b1    denied must be conducted in person (and not by way of 2-way 2    two-way audio visual communication) unless the accused 3    waives the right to be present physically in court, the 4    court determines that the physical health and safety of 5    any person necessary to the proceedings would be 6    endangered by appearing in court, or the chief judge of 7    the circuit orders use of that system due to operational 8    challenges in conducting the hearing in person. Such 9    operational challenges must be documented and approved by 10    the chief judge of the circuit, and a plan to address the 11    challenges through reasonable efforts must be presented 12    and approved by the Administrative Office of the Illinois 13    Courts every 6 months. 14        (4) If the defense seeks to compel the complaining 15    witness to testify as a witness in its favor, it shall 16    petition the court for permission. When the ends of 17    justice so require, the court may exercise its discretion 18    and compel the appearance of a complaining witness. The 19    court shall state on the record reasons for granting a 20    defense request to compel the presence of a complaining 21    witness only on the issue of the defendant's pretrial 22    detention. In making a determination under this Section, 23    the court shall state on the record the reason for 24    granting a defense request to compel the presence of a 25    complaining witness, and only grant the request if the 26    court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the   SB2705- 12 -LRB104 15520 RLC 28684 b1    defendant will be materially prejudiced if the complaining 2    witness does not appear. Cross-examination of a 3    complaining witness at the pretrial detention hearing for 4    the purpose of impeaching the witness' credibility is 5    insufficient reason to compel the presence of the witness. 6    In deciding whether to compel the appearance of a 7    complaining witness, the court shall be considerate of the 8    emotional and physical well-being of the witness. The 9    pre-trial detention hearing is not to be used for purposes 10    of discovery, and the post arraignment rules of discovery 11    do not apply. The State shall tender to the defendant, 12    prior to the hearing, copies, if any, of the defendant's 13    criminal history, if available, and any written or 14    recorded statements and the substance of any oral 15    statements made by any person, if in the State's 16    Attorney's possession at the time of the hearing. 17        (5) The rules concerning the admissibility of evidence 18    in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and 19    consideration of information at the hearing. At the trial 20    concerning the offense for which the hearing was conducted 21    neither the finding of the court nor any transcript or 22    other record of the hearing shall be admissible in the 23    State's case-in-chief, but shall be admissible for 24    impeachment, or as provided in Section 115-10.1 of this 25    Code, or in a perjury proceeding.26        (6) The defendant may not move to suppress evidence or   SB2705- 13 -LRB104 15520 RLC 28684 b1    a confession, however, evidence that proof of the charged 2    crime may have been the result of an unlawful search or 3    seizure, or both, or through improper interrogation, is 4    relevant in assessing the weight of the evidence against 5    the defendant.6        (7) Decisions regarding release, conditions of 7    release, and detention prior to trial must be 8    individualized, and no single factor or standard may be 9    used exclusively to order detention. Risk assessment tools 10    may not be used as the sole basis to deny pretrial release. 11    (g) Factors to be considered in making a determination of 12dangerousness. The court may, in determining whether the 13defendant poses a real and present threat to the safety of any 14person or persons or the community, based on the specific 15articulable facts of the case, consider, but shall not be 16limited to, evidence or testimony concerning:17        (1) The nature and circumstances of any offense 18    charged, including whether the offense is a crime of 19    violence, involving a weapon, or a sex offense.20        (2) The history and characteristics of the defendant 21    including:22            (A) Any evidence of the defendant's prior criminal 23        history indicative of violent, abusive, or assaultive 24        behavior, or lack of such behavior. Such evidence may 25        include testimony or documents received in juvenile 26        proceedings, criminal, quasi-criminal, civil   SB2705- 14 -LRB104 15520 RLC 28684 b1        commitment, domestic relations, or other proceedings.2            (B) Any evidence of the defendant's psychological, 3        psychiatric or other similar social history which 4        tends to indicate a violent, abusive, or assaultive 5        nature, or lack of any such history.6        (3) The identity of any person or persons to whose 7    safety the defendant is believed to pose a threat, and the 8    nature of the threat.9        (4) Any statements made by, or attributed to the 10    defendant, together with the circumstances surrounding 11    them.12        (5) The age and physical condition of the defendant.13        (6) The age and physical condition of any victim or 14    complaining witness. 15        (7) Whether the defendant is known to possess or have 16    access to any weapon or weapons.17        (8) Whether, at the time of the current offense or any 18    other offense or arrest, the defendant was on probation, 19    parole, aftercare release, mandatory supervised release, 20    or other release from custody pending trial, sentencing, 21    appeal, or completion of sentence for an offense under 22    federal or State state law.23        (9) Any other factors, including those listed in 24    Section 110-5 of this Article deemed by the court to have a 25    reasonable bearing upon the defendant's propensity or 26    reputation for violent, abusive, or assaultive behavior,   SB2705- 15 -LRB104 15520 RLC 28684 b1    or lack of such behavior.2    (h) Detention order. The court shall, in any order for 3detention:4        (1) make a written finding summarizing the court's 5    reasons for concluding that the defendant should be denied 6    pretrial release, including why less restrictive 7    conditions would not avoid a real and present threat to 8    the safety of any person or persons or the community, 9    based on the specific articulable facts of the case, or 10    prevent the defendant's willful flight from prosecution;11        (2) direct that the defendant be committed to the 12    custody of the sheriff for confinement in the county jail 13    pending trial;14        (3) direct that the defendant be given a reasonable 15    opportunity for private consultation with counsel, and for 16    communication with others of his or her choice by 17    visitation, mail and telephone; and18        (4) direct that the sheriff deliver the defendant as 19    required for appearances in connection with court 20    proceedings.21    (i) Detention. If the court enters an order for the 22detention of the defendant pursuant to subsection (e) of this 23Section, the defendant shall be brought to trial on the 24offense for which he is detained within 90 days after the date 25on which the order for detention was entered. If the defendant 26is not brought to trial within the 90-day period required by   SB2705- 16 -LRB104 15520 RLC 28684 b1the preceding sentence, he shall not be denied pretrial 2release. In computing the 90-day period, the court shall omit 3any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted at 4the request of the defendant and any period of delay resulting 5from a continuance granted at the request of the State with 6good cause shown pursuant to Section 103-5.7    (i-5) At each subsequent appearance of the defendant 8before the court, the judge must find that continued detention 9is necessary to avoid a real and present threat to the safety 10of any person or persons or the community, based on the 11specific articulable facts of the case, or to prevent the 12defendant's willful flight from prosecution. 13    (j) Rights of the defendant. The defendant shall be 14entitled to appeal any order entered under this Section 15denying his or her pretrial release.16    (k) Appeal. The State may appeal any order entered under 17this Section denying any motion for denial of pretrial 18release.19    (l) Presumption of innocence. Nothing in this Section 20shall be construed as modifying or limiting in any way the 21defendant's presumption of innocence in further criminal 22proceedings.23    (m) Interest of victims. 24        (1) Crime victims shall be given notice by the State's 25    Attorney's office of this hearing as required in paragraph 26    (1) of subsection (b) of Section 4.5 of the Rights of Crime   SB2705- 17 -LRB104 15520 RLC 28684 b1    Victims and Witnesses Act and shall be informed of their 2    opportunity at this hearing to obtain a protective order. 3        (2) If the defendant is denied pretrial release, the 4    court may impose a no contact provision with the victim or 5    other interested party that shall be enforced while the 6    defendant remains in custody. 7(Source: P.A. 102-1104, eff. 1-1-23; 103-822, eff. 1-1-25; 8revised 10-23-24.) 9    Section 10.

Home detention 3for purposes of credit includes restrictions on liberty such 4as curfews restricting movement for 12 hours or more per day 5and electronic monitoring that restricts travel or movement. 6Electronic monitoring is not required for home detention to be 7considered custodial for purposes of sentencing credit.

The Court may deny or 4    grant the request for continuance. If the court decides to 5    grant the continuance, the Court retains the discretion to 6    detain or release the defendant in the time between the 7    filing of the petition and the hearing.8    (d) Contents of petition.9        (1) The petition shall be verified by the State and 10    shall state the grounds upon which it contends the 11    defendant should be denied pretrial release, including the 12    real and present threat to the safety of any person or 13    persons or the community, based on the specific 14    articulable facts or flight risk, as appropriate.15        (2) If the State seeks to file a second or subsequent 16    petition under this Section, the State shall be required 17    to present a verified application setting forth in detail 18    any new facts not known or obtainable at the time of the 19    filing of the previous petition.20    (e) Eligibility: All defendants shall be presumed eligible 21for pretrial release, and the State shall bear the burden of 22proving by clear and convincing evidence that:23        (1) the proof is evident or the presumption great that 24    the defendant has committed an offense listed in 25    subsection (a), and26        (2) for offenses listed in paragraphs (1) through (7)   SB2705- 9 -LRB104 15520 RLC 28684 b1    of subsection (a), the defendant poses a real and present 2    threat to the safety of any person or persons or the 3    community, based on the specific articulable facts of the 4    case, by conduct which may include, but is not limited to, 5    a forcible felony, the obstruction of justice, 6    intimidation, injury, or abuse as defined by paragraph (1) 7    of Section 103 of the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 8    1986, and9        (3) if within the court's discretion, no condition or 10    combination of conditions set forth in subsection (b) of 11    Section 110-10 of this Article can materially mitigate (i) 12    the real and present threat to the safety of any person or 13    persons or the community, based on the specific 14    articulable facts of the case, for offenses listed in 15    paragraphs (1) through (7) of subsection (a), or (ii) the 16    defendant's willful flight for offenses listed in 17    paragraph (8) of subsection (a), and18        (4) for offenses under subsection (b) of Section 407 19    of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act that are subject 20    to paragraph (1) of subsection (a), no condition or 21    combination of conditions set forth in subsection (b) of 22    Section 110-10 of this Article can mitigate the real and 23    present threat to the safety of any person or persons or 24    the community, based on the specific articulable facts of 25    the case, and the defendant poses a serious risk to not 26    appear in court as required.  SB2705- 10 -LRB104 15520 RLC 28684 b1    (f) Conduct of the hearings.2        (1) Prior to the hearing, the State shall tender to 3    the defendant copies of the defendant's criminal history 4    available, any written or recorded statements, and the 5    substance of any oral statements made by any person, if 6    relied upon by the State in its petition, and any police 7    reports in the prosecutor's possession at the time of the 8    hearing.9        (2) The State or defendant may present evidence at the 10    hearing by way of proffer based upon reliable information.11        (3) The defendant has the right to be represented by 12    counsel, and if he or she is indigent, to have counsel 13    appointed for him or her. The defendant shall have the 14    opportunity to testify, to present witnesses on his or her 15    own behalf, and to cross-examine any witnesses that are 16    called by the State. Defense counsel shall be given 17    adequate opportunity to confer with the defendant before 18    any hearing at which conditions of release or the 19    detention of the defendant are to be considered, with an 20    accommodation for a physical condition made to facilitate 21    attorney/client consultation. If defense counsel needs to 22    confer or consult with the defendant during any hearing 23    conducted via a 2-way two-way audio-visual communication 24    system, such consultation shall not be recorded and shall 25    be undertaken consistent with constitutional protections. 26        (3.5) A hearing at which pretrial release may be   SB2705- 11 -LRB104 15520 RLC 28684 b1    denied must be conducted in person (and not by way of 2-way 2    two-way audio visual communication) unless the accused 3    waives the right to be present physically in court, the 4    court determines that the physical health and safety of 5    any person necessary to the proceedings would be 6    endangered by appearing in court, or the chief judge of 7    the circuit orders use of that system due to operational 8    challenges in conducting the hearing in person. Such 9    operational challenges must be documented and approved by 10    the chief judge of the circuit, and a plan to address the 11    challenges through reasonable efforts must be presented 12    and approved by the Administrative Office of the Illinois 13    Courts every 6 months. 14        (4) If the defense seeks to compel the complaining 15    witness to testify as a witness in its favor, it shall 16    petition the court for permission. When the ends of 17    justice so require, the court may exercise its discretion 18    and compel the appearance of a complaining witness. The 19    court shall state on the record reasons for granting a 20    defense request to compel the presence of a complaining 21    witness only on the issue of the defendant's pretrial 22    detention. In making a determination under this Section, 23    the court shall state on the record the reason for 24    granting a defense request to compel the presence of a 25    complaining witness, and only grant the request if the 26    court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the   SB2705- 12 -LRB104 15520 RLC 28684 b1    defendant will be materially prejudiced if the complaining 2    witness does not appear. Cross-examination of a 3    complaining witness at the pretrial detention hearing for 4    the purpose of impeaching the witness' credibility is 5    insufficient reason to compel the presence of the witness. 6    In deciding whether to compel the appearance of a 7    complaining witness, the court shall be considerate of the 8    emotional and physical well-being of the witness. The 9    pre-trial detention hearing is not to be used for purposes 10    of discovery, and the post arraignment rules of discovery 11    do not apply. The State shall tender to the defendant, 12    prior to the hearing, copies, if any, of the defendant's 13    criminal history, if available, and any written or 14    recorded statements and the substance of any oral 15    statements made by any person, if in the State's 16    Attorney's possession at the time of the hearing. 17        (5) The rules concerning the admissibility of evidence 18    in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and 19    consideration of information at the hearing. At the trial 20    concerning the offense for which the hearing was conducted 21    neither the finding of the court nor any transcript or 22    other record of the hearing shall be admissible in the 23    State's case-in-chief, but shall be admissible for 24    impeachment, or as provided in Section 115-10.1 of this 25    Code, or in a perjury proceeding.26        (6) The defendant may not move to suppress evidence or   SB2705- 13 -LRB104 15520 RLC 28684 b1    a confession, however, evidence that proof of the charged 2    crime may have been the result of an unlawful search or 3    seizure, or both, or through improper interrogation, is 4    relevant in assessing the weight of the evidence against 5    the defendant.6        (7) Decisions regarding release, conditions of 7    release, and detention prior to trial must be 8    individualized, and no single factor or standard may be 9    used exclusively to order detention. Risk assessment tools 10    may not be used as the sole basis to deny pretrial release. 11    (g) Factors to be considered in making a determination of 12dangerousness. The court may, in determining whether the 13defendant poses a real and present threat to the safety of any 14person or persons or the community, based on the specific 15articulable facts of the case, consider, but shall not be 16limited to, evidence or testimony concerning:17        (1) The nature and circumstances of any offense 18    charged, including whether the offense is a crime of 19    violence, involving a weapon, or a sex offense.20        (2) The history and characteristics of the defendant 21    including:22            (A) Any evidence of the defendant's prior criminal 23        history indicative of violent, abusive, or assaultive 24        behavior, or lack of such behavior. Such evidence may 25        include testimony or documents received in juvenile 26        proceedings, criminal, quasi-criminal, civil   SB2705- 14 -LRB104 15520 RLC 28684 b1        commitment, domestic relations, or other proceedings.2            (B) Any evidence of the defendant's psychological, 3        psychiatric or other similar social history which 4        tends to indicate a violent, abusive, or assaultive 5        nature, or lack of any such history.6        (3) The identity of any person or persons to whose 7    safety the defendant is believed to pose a threat, and the 8    nature of the threat.9        (4) Any statements made by, or attributed to the 10    defendant, together with the circumstances surrounding 11    them.12        (5) The age and physical condition of the defendant.13        (6) The age and physical condition of any victim or 14    complaining witness. 15        (7) Whether the defendant is known to possess or have 16    access to any weapon or weapons.17        (8) Whether, at the time of the current offense or any 18    other offense or arrest, the defendant was on probation, 19    parole, aftercare release, mandatory supervised release, 20    or other release from custody pending trial, sentencing, 21    appeal, or completion of sentence for an offense under 22    federal or State state law.23        (9) Any other factors, including those listed in 24    Section 110-5 of this Article deemed by the court to have a 25    reasonable bearing upon the defendant's propensity or 26    reputation for violent, abusive, or assaultive behavior,   SB2705- 15 -LRB104 15520 RLC 28684 b1    or lack of such behavior.2    (h) Detention order. The court shall, in any order for 3detention:4        (1) make a written finding summarizing the court's 5    reasons for concluding that the defendant should be denied 6    pretrial release, including why less restrictive 7    conditions would not avoid a real and present threat to 8    the safety of any person or persons or the community, 9    based on the specific articulable facts of the case, or 10    prevent the defendant's willful flight from prosecution;11        (2) direct that the defendant be committed to the 12    custody of the sheriff for confinement in the county jail 13    pending trial;14        (3) direct that the defendant be given a reasonable 15    opportunity for private consultation with counsel, and for 16    communication with others of his or her choice by 17    visitation, mail and telephone; and18        (4) direct that the sheriff deliver the defendant as 19    required for appearances in connection with court 20    proceedings.21    (i) Detention. If the court enters an order for the 22detention of the defendant pursuant to subsection (e) of this 23Section, the defendant shall be brought to trial on the 24offense for which he is detained within 90 days after the date 25on which the order for detention was entered. If the defendant 26is not brought to trial within the 90-day period required by   SB2705- 16 -LRB104 15520 RLC 28684 b1the preceding sentence, he shall not be denied pretrial 2release. In computing the 90-day period, the court shall omit 3any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted at 4the request of the defendant and any period of delay resulting 5from a continuance granted at the request of the State with 6good cause shown pursuant to Section 103-5.7    (i-5) At each subsequent appearance of the defendant 8before the court, the judge must find that continued detention 9is necessary to avoid a real and present threat to the safety 10of any person or persons or the community, based on the 11specific articulable facts of the case, or to prevent the 12defendant's willful flight from prosecution. 13    (j) Rights of the defendant. The defendant shall be 14entitled to appeal any order entered under this Section 15denying his or her pretrial release.16    (k) Appeal. The State may appeal any order entered under 17this Section denying any motion for denial of pretrial 18release.19    (l) Presumption of innocence. Nothing in this Section 20shall be construed as modifying or limiting in any way the 21defendant's presumption of innocence in further criminal 22proceedings.23    (m) Interest of victims. 24        (1) Crime victims shall be given notice by the State's 25    Attorney's office of this hearing as required in paragraph 26    (1) of subsection (b) of Section 4.5 of the Rights of Crime   SB2705- 17 -LRB104 15520 RLC 28684 b1    Victims and Witnesses Act and shall be informed of their 2    opportunity at this hearing to obtain a protective order. 3        (2) If the defendant is denied pretrial release, the 4    court may impose a no contact provision with the victim or 5    other interested party that shall be enforced while the 6    defendant remains in custody. 7(Source: P.A. 102-1104, eff. 1-1-23; 103-822, eff. 1-1-25; 8revised 10-23-24.) 9    Section 10.

Home detention 3for purposes of credit includes restrictions on liberty such 4as curfews restricting movement for 12 hours or more per day 5and electronic monitoring that restricts travel or movement. 6Electronic monitoring is not required for home detention to be 7considered custodial for purposes of sentencing credit.
