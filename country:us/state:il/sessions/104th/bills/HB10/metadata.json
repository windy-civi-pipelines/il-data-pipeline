Requires the Department of Children and Family Services to: (1) establish and maintain a decentralized supply of luggage to be used to transport the belongings of any child in the foster care system; and (2) develop procedures for the storage and distribution of luggage. Requires the Department to provide luggage to a child who is being removed from home or changing placement. Requires the Department, subject to appropriation, to purchase luggage that cannot otherwise be provided through grant or donation to ensure a sufficient supply of luggage for foster children. Provides that the Department shall submit an annual report to the Governor and the General Assembly that summarizes: (i) the number of times a trash bag was used to transport a foster child's personal belongings and the reasons the Department failed to provide the child with appropriate luggage; and (ii) the Department's supply inventory and inventory management practices for its luggage supply."
