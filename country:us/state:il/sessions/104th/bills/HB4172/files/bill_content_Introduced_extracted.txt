Effective immediately.LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b  A BILL FOR HB4172LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1    AN ACT concerning regulation. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Findings; intent.5    (a) The General Assembly finds that substantial security 6deposits as a condition of interconnection or service for 7large demand project applicants unreasonably deter new 8investment and delay construction of facilities that otherwise 9comply with existing interconnection and tariff requirements.10    (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to promote 11economic development and attract investment in advanced 12manufacturing and digital infrastructure, including 13large-scale data centers. 14    (b) The changes made by this amendatory Act of the 104th 15General Assembly are intended to provide temporary relief to 16large demand project applicants until the General Assembly and 17the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission implement policies 18regarding utility deposit practices and transmission service 19agreements, respectively. 20    (c) This amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly is 21not intended to delay the interconnection or service of large 22demand project applicants. 23    Section 5. The Public Utilities Act is amended by changing   HB4172- 2 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1Section 16-108 as follows: 2    (220 ILCS 5/16-108)3    Sec. 16-108. Recovery of costs associated with the 4provision of delivery and other services.5    (a) An electric utility shall file a delivery services 6tariff with the Commission at least 210 days prior to the date 7that it is required to begin offering such services pursuant 8to this Act. An electric utility shall provide the components 9of delivery services that are subject to the jurisdiction of 10the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission at the same prices, 11terms and conditions set forth in its applicable tariff as 12approved or allowed into effect by that Commission. The 13Commission shall otherwise have the authority pursuant to 14Article IX to review, approve, and modify the prices, terms 15and conditions of those components of delivery services not 16subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory 17Commission, including the authority to determine the extent to 18which such delivery services should be offered on an unbundled 19basis. In making any such determination the Commission shall 20consider, at a minimum, the effect of additional unbundling on 21(i) the objective of just and reasonable rates, (ii) electric 22utility employees, and (iii) the development of competitive 23markets for electric energy services in Illinois.24    (b) The Commission shall enter an order approving, or 25approving as modified, the delivery services tariff no later   HB4172- 3 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1than 30 days prior to the date on which the electric utility 2must commence offering such services. The Commission may 3subsequently modify such tariff pursuant to this Act.4    (c) The electric utility's tariffs shall define the 5classes of its customers for purposes of delivery services 6charges. Delivery services shall be priced and made available 7to all retail customers electing delivery services in each 8such class on a nondiscriminatory basis regardless of whether 9the retail customer chooses the electric utility, an affiliate 10of the electric utility, or another entity as its supplier of 11electric power and energy. Charges for delivery services shall 12be cost based, and shall allow the electric utility to recover 13the costs of providing delivery services through its charges 14to its delivery service customers that use the facilities and 15services associated with such costs. Such costs shall include 16the costs of owning, operating and maintaining transmission 17and distribution facilities. The Commission shall also be 18authorized to consider whether, and if so to what extent, the 19following costs are appropriately included in the electric 20utility's delivery services rates: (i) the costs of that 21portion of generation facilities used for the production and 22absorption of reactive power in order that retail customers 23located in the electric utility's service area can receive 24electric power and energy from suppliers other than the 25electric utility, and (ii) the costs associated with the use 26and redispatch of generation facilities to mitigate   HB4172- 4 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1constraints on the transmission or distribution system in 2order that retail customers located in the electric utility's 3service area can receive electric power and energy from 4suppliers other than the electric utility. Nothing in this 5subsection shall be construed as directing the Commission to 6allocate any of the costs described in (i) or (ii) that are 7found to be appropriately included in the electric utility's 8delivery services rates to any particular customer group or 9geographic area in setting delivery services rates.10    (d) The Commission shall establish charges, terms and 11conditions for delivery services that are just and reasonable 12and shall take into account customer impacts when establishing 13such charges. In establishing charges, terms and conditions 14for delivery services, the Commission shall take into account 15voltage level differences. A retail customer shall have the 16option to request to purchase electric service at any delivery 17service voltage reasonably and technically feasible from the 18electric facilities serving that customer's premises provided 19that there are no significant adverse impacts upon system 20reliability or system efficiency. A retail customer shall also 21have the option to request to purchase electric service at any 22point of delivery that is reasonably and technically feasible 23provided that there are no significant adverse impacts on 24system reliability or efficiency. Such requests shall not be 25unreasonably denied.26    (e) Electric utilities shall recover the costs of   HB4172- 5 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1installing, operating or maintaining facilities for the 2particular benefit of one or more delivery services customers, 3including without limitation any costs incurred in complying 4with a customer's request to be served at a different voltage 5level, directly from the retail customer or customers for 6whose benefit the costs were incurred, to the extent such 7costs are not recovered through the charges referred to in 8subsections (c) and (d) of this Section.9    (e-5) Notwithstanding any provision of this Act, an 10electric utility shall not require or collect a security 11deposit, a cash deposit, a letter of credit, an advance 12payment, or any other equivalent financial assurance from a 13large demand project applicant who submits a service or 14interconnection request if that applicant (1) submitted an 15application for interconnection or service under existing 16Commission-approved tariffs and (2) is in good standing with 17the interconnection and construction requirements applicable 18to the applicant's service request.19    An electric utility shall not delay investment to support, 20provide service, or interconnect large demand project 21applicants as a result of the changes made by this amendatory 22Act of the 104th General Assembly. Nothing in this subsection 23(e-5) shall be construed to limit the following:24        (1) a utility's enforcement of Commission-approved 25    technical standards for interconnection;26        (2) a utility's enforcement of reasonable milestones   HB4172- 6 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1    for construction progress; and2        (3) a utility's ability to recover all costs prudently 3    and reasonably incurred.4    This amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly shall 5preempt and supersede any final Commission orders entered in 6Docket Nos. 25-677, 25-679, and any other applicable Docket, 7to the extent the orders are inconsistent with this subsection 8(e-5). 9    As used in this subsection (e-5), "large demand project 10applicant" means an applicant or customer who requests a 11revised or new service or revised or new facilities for a 12project with a projected load of over 50 megawatts.13    The provisions of this subsection (e-5) are inoperative 14September 1, 2026. 15    (f) An electric utility shall be entitled but not required 16to implement transition charges in conjunction with the 17offering of delivery services pursuant to Section 16-104. If 18an electric utility implements transition charges, it shall 19implement such charges for all delivery services customers and 20for all customers described in subsection (h), but shall not 21implement transition charges for power and energy that a 22retail customer takes from cogeneration or self-generation 23facilities located on that retail customer's premises, if such 24facilities meet the following criteria: 25        (i) the cogeneration or self-generation facilities 26    serve a single retail customer and are located on that   HB4172- 7 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1    retail customer's premises (for purposes of this 2    subparagraph and subparagraph (ii), an industrial or 3    manufacturing retail customer and a third party contractor 4    that is served by such industrial or manufacturing 5    customer through such retail customer's own electrical 6    distribution facilities under the circumstances described 7    in subsection (vi) of the definition of "alternative 8    retail electric supplier" set forth in Section 16-102, 9    shall be considered a single retail customer); 10        (ii) the cogeneration or self-generation facilities 11    either (A) are sized pursuant to generally accepted 12    engineering standards for the retail customer's electrical 13    load at that premises (taking into account standby or 14    other reliability considerations related to that retail 15    customer's operations at that site) or (B) if the facility 16    is a cogeneration facility located on the retail 17    customer's premises, the retail customer is the thermal 18    host for that facility and the facility has been designed 19    to meet that retail customer's thermal energy requirements 20    resulting in electrical output beyond that retail 21    customer's electrical demand at that premises, comply with 22    the operating and efficiency standards applicable to 23    "qualifying facilities" specified in title 18 Code of 24    Federal Regulations Section 292.205 as in effect on the 25    effective date of this amendatory Act of 1999; 26        (iii) the retail customer on whose premises the   HB4172- 8 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1    facilities are located either has an exclusive right to 2    receive, and corresponding obligation to pay for, all of 3    the electrical capacity of the facility, or in the case of 4    a cogeneration facility that has been designed to meet the 5    retail customer's thermal energy requirements at that 6    premises, an identified amount of the electrical capacity 7    of the facility, over a minimum 5-year period; and 8        (iv) if the cogeneration facility is sized for the 9    retail customer's thermal load at that premises but 10    exceeds the electrical load, any sales of excess power or 11    energy are made only at wholesale, are subject to the 12    jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 13    and are not for the purpose of circumventing the 14    provisions of this subsection (f).15If a generation facility located at a retail customer's 16premises does not meet the above criteria, an electric utility 17implementing transition charges shall implement a transition 18charge until December 31, 2006 for any power and energy taken 19by such retail customer from such facility as if such power and 20energy had been delivered by the electric utility. Provided, 21however, that an industrial retail customer that is taking 22power from a generation facility that does not meet the above 23criteria but that is located on such customer's premises will 24not be subject to a transition charge for the power and energy 25taken by such retail customer from such generation facility if 26the facility does not serve any other retail customer and   HB4172- 9 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1either was installed on behalf of the customer and for its own 2use prior to January 1, 1997, or is both predominantly fueled 3by byproducts of such customer's manufacturing process at such 4premises and sells or offers an average of 300 megawatts or 5more of electricity produced from such generation facility 6into the wholesale market. Such charges shall be calculated as 7provided in Section 16-102, and shall be collected on each 8kilowatt-hour delivered under a delivery services tariff to a 9retail customer from the date the customer first takes 10delivery services until December 31, 2006 except as provided 11in subsection (h) of this Section. Provided, however, that an 12electric utility, other than an electric utility providing 13service to at least 1,000,000 customers in this State on 14January 1, 1999, shall be entitled to petition for entry of an 15order by the Commission authorizing the electric utility to 16implement transition charges for an additional period ending 17no later than December 31, 2008. The electric utility shall 18file its petition with supporting evidence no earlier than 16 19months, and no later than 12 months, prior to December 31, 202006. The Commission shall hold a hearing on the electric 21utility's petition and shall enter its order no later than 8 22months after the petition is filed. The Commission shall 23determine whether and to what extent the electric utility 24shall be authorized to implement transition charges for an 25additional period. The Commission may authorize the electric 26utility to implement transition charges for some or all of the   HB4172- 10 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1additional period, and shall determine the mitigation factors 2to be used in implementing such transition charges; provided, 3that the Commission shall not authorize mitigation factors 4less than 110% of those in effect during the 12 months ended 5December 31, 2006. In making its determination, the Commission 6shall consider the following factors: the necessity to 7implement transition charges for an additional period in order 8to maintain the financial integrity of the electric utility; 9the prudence of the electric utility's actions in reducing its 10costs since the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1997; 11the ability of the electric utility to provide safe, adequate 12and reliable service to retail customers in its service area; 13and the impact on competition of allowing the electric utility 14to implement transition charges for the additional period.15    (g) The electric utility shall file tariffs that establish 16the transition charges to be paid by each class of customers to 17the electric utility in conjunction with the provision of 18delivery services. The electric utility's tariffs shall define 19the classes of its customers for purposes of calculating 20transition charges. The electric utility's tariffs shall 21provide for the calculation of transition charges on a 22customer-specific basis for any retail customer whose average 23monthly maximum electrical demand on the electric utility's 24system during the 6 months with the customer's highest monthly 25maximum electrical demands equals or exceeds 3.0 megawatts for 26electric utilities having more than 1,000,000 customers, and   HB4172- 11 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1for other electric utilities for any customer that has an 2average monthly maximum electrical demand on the electric 3utility's system of one megawatt or more, and (A) for which 4there exists data on the customer's usage during the 3 years 5preceding the date that the customer became eligible to take 6delivery services, or (B) for which there does not exist data 7on the customer's usage during the 3 years preceding the date 8that the customer became eligible to take delivery services, 9if in the electric utility's reasonable judgment there exists 10comparable usage information or a sufficient basis to develop 11such information, and further provided that the electric 12utility can require customers for which an individual 13calculation is made to sign contracts that set forth the 14transition charges to be paid by the customer to the electric 15utility pursuant to the tariff.16    (h) An electric utility shall also be entitled to file 17tariffs that allow it to collect transition charges from 18retail customers in the electric utility's service area that 19do not take delivery services but that take electric power or 20energy from an alternative retail electric supplier or from an 21electric utility other than the electric utility in whose 22service area the customer is located. Such charges shall be 23calculated, in accordance with the definition of transition 24charges in Section 16-102, for the period of time that the 25customer would be obligated to pay transition charges if it 26were taking delivery services, except that no deduction for   HB4172- 12 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1delivery services revenues shall be made in such calculation, 2and usage data from the customer's class shall be used where 3historical usage data is not available for the individual 4customer. The customer shall be obligated to pay such charges 5on a lump sum basis on or before the date on which the customer 6commences to take service from the alternative retail electric 7supplier or other electric utility, provided, that the 8electric utility in whose service area the customer is located 9shall offer the customer the option of signing a contract 10pursuant to which the customer pays such charges ratably over 11the period in which the charges would otherwise have applied.12    (i) An electric utility shall be entitled to add to the 13bills of delivery services customers charges pursuant to 14Sections 9-221, 9-222 (except as provided in Section 9-222.1), 15and Section 16-114 of this Act, Section 5-5 of the Electricity 16Infrastructure Maintenance Fee Law, Section 6-5 of the 17Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, and Coal Resources 18Development Law of 1997, and Section 13 of the Energy 19Assistance Act.20    (i-5) An electric utility required to impose the Coal to 21Solar and Energy Storage Initiative Charge provided for in 22subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency 23Act shall add such charge to the bills of its delivery services 24customers pursuant to the terms of a tariff conforming to the 25requirements of subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the 26Illinois Power Agency Act and this subsection (i-5) and filed   HB4172- 13 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1with and approved by the Commission. The electric utility 2shall file its proposed tariff with the Commission on or 3before July 1, 2022 to be effective, after review and approval 4or modification by the Commission, beginning January 1, 2023. 5On or before December 1, 2022, the Commission shall review the 6electric utility's proposed tariff, including by conducting a 7docketed proceeding if deemed necessary by the Commission, and 8shall approve the proposed tariff or direct the electric 9utility to make modifications the Commission finds necessary 10for the tariff to conform to the requirements of subsection 11(c-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act and this 12subsection (i-5). The electric utility's tariff shall provide 13for imposition of the Coal to Solar and Energy Storage 14Initiative Charge on a per-kilowatthour basis to all 15kilowatthours delivered by the electric utility to its 16delivery services customers. The tariff shall provide for the 17calculation of the Coal to Solar and Energy Storage Initiative 18Charge to be in effect for the year beginning January 1, 2023 19and each year beginning January 1 thereafter, sufficient to 20collect the electric utility's estimated payment obligations 21for the delivery year beginning the following June 1 under 22contracts for purchase of renewable energy credits entered 23into pursuant to subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the 24Illinois Power Agency Act and the obligations of the 25Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, or any 26successor department or agency, which for purposes of this   HB4172- 14 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1subsection (i-5) shall be referred to as the Department, to 2make grant payments during such delivery year from the Coal to 3Solar and Energy Storage Initiative Fund pursuant to grant 4contracts entered into pursuant to subsection (c-5) of Section 51-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, and using the electric 6utility's kilowatthour deliveries to its delivery services 7customers during the delivery year ended May 31 of the 8preceding calendar year. On or before November 1 of each year 9beginning November 1, 2022, the Department shall notify the 10electric utilities of the amount of the Department's estimated 11obligations for grant payments during the delivery year 12beginning the following June 1 pursuant to grant contracts 13entered into pursuant to subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of 14the Illinois Power Agency Act; and each electric utility shall 15incorporate in the calculation of its Coal to Solar and Energy 16Storage Initiative Charge the fractional portion of the 17Department's estimated obligations equal to the electric 18utility's kilowatthour deliveries to its delivery services 19customers in the delivery year ended the preceding May 31 20divided by the aggregate deliveries of both electric utilities 21to delivery services customers in such delivery year. The 22electric utility shall remit on a monthly basis to the State 23Treasurer, for deposit in the Coal to Solar and Energy Storage 24Initiative Fund provided for in subsection (c-5) of Section 251-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, the electric utility's 26collections of the Coal to Solar and Energy Storage Initiative   HB4172- 15 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1Charge estimated to be needed by the Department for grant 2payments pursuant to grant contracts entered into pursuant to 3subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency 4Act. The initial charge under the electric utility's tariff 5shall be effective for kilowatthours delivered beginning 6January 1, 2023, and thereafter shall be revised to be 7effective January 1, 2024 and each January 1 thereafter, based 8on the payment obligations for the delivery year beginning the 9following June 1. The tariff shall provide for the electric 10utility to make an annual filing with the Commission on or 11before November 15 of each year, beginning in 2023, setting 12forth the Coal to Solar and Energy Storage Initiative Charge 13to be in effect for the year beginning the following January 1. 14The electric utility's tariff shall also provide that the 15electric utility shall make a filing with the Commission on or 16before August 1 of each year beginning in 2024 setting forth a 17reconciliation, for the delivery year ended the preceding May 1831, of the electric utility's collections of the Coal to Solar 19and Energy Storage Initiative Charge against actual payments 20for renewable energy credits pursuant to contracts entered 21into, and the actual grant payments by the Department pursuant 22to grant contracts entered into, pursuant to subsection (c-5) 23of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act. The tariff 24shall provide that any excess or shortfall of collections to 25payments shall be deducted from or added to, on a 26per-kilowatthour basis, the Coal to Solar and Energy Storage   HB4172- 16 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1Initiative Charge, over the 6-month period beginning October 1 2of that calendar year. 3    (j) If a retail customer that obtains electric power and 4energy from cogeneration or self-generation facilities 5installed for its own use on or before January 1, 1997, 6subsequently takes service from an alternative retail electric 7supplier or an electric utility other than the electric 8utility in whose service area the customer is located for any 9portion of the customer's electric power and energy 10requirements formerly obtained from those facilities 11(including that amount purchased from the utility in lieu of 12such generation and not as standby power purchases, under a 13cogeneration displacement tariff in effect as of the effective 14date of this amendatory Act of 1997), the transition charges 15otherwise applicable pursuant to subsections (f), (g), or (h) 16of this Section shall not be applicable in any year to that 17portion of the customer's electric power and energy 18requirements formerly obtained from those facilities, 19provided, that for purposes of this subsection (j), such 20portion shall not exceed the average number of kilowatt-hours 21per year obtained from the cogeneration or self-generation 22facilities during the 3 years prior to the date on which the 23customer became eligible for delivery services, except as 24provided in subsection (f) of Section 16-110.25    (k) The electric utility shall be entitled to recover 26through tariffed charges all of the costs associated with the   HB4172- 17 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1purchase of zero emission credits from zero emission 2facilities to meet the requirements of subsection (d-5) of 3Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act and all of the 4costs associated with the purchase of carbon mitigation 5credits from carbon-free energy resources to meet the 6requirements of subsection (d-10) of Section 1-75 of the 7Illinois Power Agency Act. Such costs shall include the costs 8of procuring the zero emission credits and carbon mitigation 9credits from carbon-free energy resources, as well as the 10reasonable costs that the utility incurs as part of the 11procurement processes and to implement and comply with plans 12and processes approved by the Commission under subsections 13(d-5) and (d-10). The costs shall be allocated across all 14retail customers through a single, uniform cents per 15kilowatt-hour charge applicable to all retail customers, which 16shall appear as a separate line item on each customer's bill. 17Beginning June 1, 2017, the electric utility shall be entitled 18to recover through tariffed charges all of the costs 19associated with the purchase of renewable energy resources to 20meet the renewable energy resource standards of subsection (c) 21of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, under 22procurement plans as approved in accordance with that Section 23and Section 16-111.5 of this Act. Such costs shall include the 24costs of procuring the renewable energy resources, as well as 25the reasonable costs that the utility incurs as part of the 26procurement processes and to implement and comply with plans   HB4172- 18 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1and processes approved by the Commission under such Sections. 2The costs associated with the purchase of renewable energy 3resources shall be allocated across all retail customers in 4proportion to the amount of renewable energy resources the 5utility procures for such customers through a single, uniform 6cents per kilowatt-hour charge applicable to such retail 7customers, which shall appear as a separate line item on each 8such customer's bill. The credits, costs, and penalties 9associated with the self-direct renewable portfolio standard 10compliance program described in subparagraph (R) of paragraph 11(1) of subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power 12Agency Act shall be allocated to approved eligible self-direct 13customers by the utility in a cents per kilowatt-hour credit, 14cost, or penalty, which shall appear as a separate line item on 15each such customer's bill. 16    Notwithstanding whether the Commission has approved the 17initial long-term renewable resources procurement plan as of 18June 1, 2017, an electric utility shall place new tariffed 19charges into effect beginning with the June 2017 monthly 20billing period, to the extent practicable, to begin recovering 21the costs of procuring renewable energy resources, as those 22charges are calculated under the limitations described in 23subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of Section 241-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act. Notwithstanding the 25date on which the utility places such new tariffed charges 26into effect, the utility shall be permitted to collect the   HB4172- 19 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1charges under such tariff as if the tariff had been in effect 2beginning with the first day of the June 2017 monthly billing 3period. For the delivery years commencing June 1, 2017, June 41, 2018, June 1, 2019, and each delivery year thereafter, the 5electric utility shall deposit into a separate interest 6bearing account of a financial institution the monies 7collected under the tariffed charges. Money collected from 8customers for the procurement of renewable energy resources in 9a given delivery year may be spent by the utility for the 10procurement of renewable resources over any of the following 5 11delivery years, after which unspent money shall be credited 12back to retail customers. The electric utility shall spend all 13money collected in earlier delivery years that has not yet 14been returned to customers, first, before spending money 15collected in later delivery years. Any interest earned shall 16be credited back to retail customers under the reconciliation 17proceeding provided for in this subsection (k), provided that 18the electric utility shall first be reimbursed from the 19interest for the administrative costs that it incurs to 20administer and manage the account. Any taxes due on the funds 21in the account, or interest earned on it, will be paid from the 22account or, if insufficient monies are available in the 23account, from the monies collected under the tariffed charges 24to recover the costs of procuring renewable energy resources. 25Monies deposited in the account shall be subject to the 26review, reconciliation, and true-up process described in this   HB4172- 20 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1subsection (k) that is applicable to the funds collected and 2costs incurred for the procurement of renewable energy 3resources.4    The electric utility shall be entitled to recover all of 5the costs identified in this subsection (k) through automatic 6adjustment clause tariffs applicable to all of the utility's 7retail customers that allow the electric utility to adjust its 8tariffed charges consistent with this subsection (k). The 9determination as to whether any excess funds were collected 10during a given delivery year for the purchase of renewable 11energy resources, and the crediting of any excess funds back 12to retail customers, shall not be made until after the close of 13the delivery year, which will ensure that the maximum amount 14of funds is available to implement the approved long-term 15renewable resources procurement plan during a given delivery 16year. The amount of excess funds eligible to be credited back 17to retail customers shall be reduced by an amount equal to the 18payment obligations required by any contracts entered into by 19an electric utility under contracts described in subsection 20(b) of Section 1-56 and subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of the 21Illinois Power Agency Act, even if such payments have not yet 22been made and regardless of the delivery year in which those 23payment obligations were incurred. Notwithstanding anything to 24the contrary, including in tariffs authorized by this 25subsection (k) in effect before the effective date of this 26amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, all unspent   HB4172- 21 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1funds as of May 31, 2021, excluding any funds credited to 2customers during any utility billing cycle that commences 3prior to the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd 4General Assembly, shall remain in the utility account and 5shall on a first in, first out basis be used toward utility 6payment obligations under contracts described in subsection 7(b) of Section 1-56 and subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of the 8Illinois Power Agency Act. The electric utility's collections 9under such automatic adjustment clause tariffs to recover the 10costs of renewable energy resources, zero emission credits 11from zero emission facilities, and carbon mitigation credits 12from carbon-free energy resources shall be subject to separate 13annual review, reconciliation, and true-up against actual 14costs by the Commission under a procedure that shall be 15specified in the electric utility's automatic adjustment 16clause tariffs and that shall be approved by the Commission in 17connection with its approval of such tariffs. The procedure 18shall provide that any difference between the electric 19utility's collections for zero emission credits and carbon 20mitigation credits under the automatic adjustment charges for 21an annual period and the electric utility's actual costs of 22zero emission credits from zero emission facilities and carbon 23mitigation credits from carbon-free energy resources for that 24same annual period shall be refunded to or collected from, as 25applicable, the electric utility's retail customers in 26subsequent periods.  HB4172- 22 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1    Nothing in this subsection (k) is intended to affect, 2limit, or change the right of the electric utility to recover 3the costs associated with the procurement of renewable energy 4resources for periods commencing before, on, or after June 1, 52017, as otherwise provided in the Illinois Power Agency Act. 6    The funding available under this subsection (k), if any, 7for the programs described under subsection (b) of Section 81-56 of the Illinois Power Agency Act shall not reduce the 9amount of funding for the programs described in subparagraph 10(O) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of the 11Illinois Power Agency Act. If funding is available under this 12subsection (k) for programs described under subsection (b) of 13Section 1-56 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, then the 14long-term renewable resources plan shall provide for the 15Agency to procure contracts in an amount that does not exceed 16the funding, and the contracts approved by the Commission 17shall be executed by the applicable utility or utilities. 18    (l) A utility that has terminated any contract executed 19under subsection (d-5) or (d-10) of Section 1-75 of the 20Illinois Power Agency Act shall be entitled to recover any 21remaining balance associated with the purchase of zero 22emission credits prior to such termination, and such utility 23shall also apply a credit to its retail customer bills in the 24event of any over-collection. 25    (m)(1) An electric utility that recovers its costs of 26procuring zero emission credits from zero emission facilities   HB4172- 23 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1through a cents-per-kilowatthour charge under subsection (k) 2of this Section shall be subject to the requirements of this 3subsection (m). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, such 4electric utility shall, beginning on April 30, 2018, and each 5April 30 thereafter until April 30, 2026, calculate whether 6any reduction must be applied to such cents-per-kilowatthour 7charge that is paid by retail customers of the electric 8utility that have opted out of subsections (a) through (j) of 9Section 8-103B of this Act under subsection (l) of Section 108-103B. Such charge shall be reduced for such customers for 11the next delivery year commencing on June 1 based on the amount 12necessary, if any, to limit the annual estimated average net 13increase for the prior calendar year due to the future energy 14investment costs to no more than 1.3% of 5.98 cents per 15kilowatt-hour, which is the average amount paid per 16kilowatthour for electric service during the year ending 17December 31, 2015 by Illinois industrial retail customers, as 18reported to the Edison Electric Institute. 19    The calculations required by this subsection (m) shall be 20made only once for each year, and no subsequent rate impact 21determinations shall be made. 22    (2) For purposes of this Section, "future energy 23investment costs" shall be calculated by subtracting the 24cents-per-kilowatthour charge identified in subparagraph (A) 25of this paragraph (2) from the sum of the 26cents-per-kilowatthour charges identified in subparagraph (B)   HB4172- 24 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1of this paragraph (2): 2        (A) The cents-per-kilowatthour charge identified in 3    the electric utility's tariff placed into effect under 4    Section 8-103 of the Public Utilities Act that, on 5    December 1, 2016, was applicable to those retail customers 6    that have opted out of subsections (a) through (j) of 7    Section 8-103B of this Act under subsection (l) of Section 8    8-103B. 9        (B) The sum of the following cents-per-kilowatthour 10    charges applicable to those retail customers that have 11    opted out of subsections (a) through (j) of Section 8-103B 12    of this Act under subsection (l) of Section 8-103B, 13    provided that if one or more of the following charges has 14    been in effect and applied to such customers for more than 15    one calendar year, then each charge shall be equal to the 16    average of the charges applied over a period that 17    commences with the calendar year ending December 31, 2017 18    and ends with the most recently completed calendar year 19    prior to the calculation required by this subsection (m): 20            (i) the cents-per-kilowatthour charge to recover 21        the costs incurred by the utility under subsection 22        (d-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency 23        Act, adjusted for any reductions required under this 24        subsection (m); and25            (ii) the cents-per-kilowatthour charge to recover 26        the costs incurred by the utility under Section   HB4172- 25 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1        16-107.6 of the Public Utilities Act. 2        If no charge was applied for a given calendar year 3    under item (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph (B), then the 4    value of the charge for that year shall be zero. 5    (3) If a reduction is required by the calculation 6performed under this subsection (m), then the amount of the 7reduction shall be multiplied by the number of years reflected 8in the averages calculated under subparagraph (B) of paragraph 9(2) of this subsection (m). Such reduction shall be applied to 10the cents-per-kilowatthour charge that is applicable to those 11retail customers that have opted out of subsections (a) 12through (j) of Section 8-103B of this Act under subsection (l) 13of Section 8-103B beginning with the next delivery year 14commencing after the date of the calculation required by this 15subsection (m). 16    (4) The electric utility shall file a notice with the 17Commission on May 1 of 2018 and each May 1 thereafter until May 181, 2026 containing the reduction, if any, which must be 19applied for the delivery year which begins in the year of the 20filing. The notice shall contain the calculations made 21pursuant to this Section. By October 1 of each year beginning 22in 2018, each electric utility shall notify the Commission if 23it appears, based on an estimate of the calculation required 24in this subsection (m), that a reduction will be required in 25the next year. 26(Source: P.A. 102-662, eff. 9-15-21.)   HB4172- 26 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1    Section 99.

Dave Vella SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: 220 ILCS 5/16-108    Amends the Public Utilities Act. In provisions concerning the recovery of costs associated with the provision of delivery and other services, provides that electric utilities shall not require or collect any security deposit, cash deposit, letter of credit, advance payment, or any other equivalent financial assurance from a large demand project applicant who submits a service or interconnection request if that applicant (1) submitted an application for interconnection or service under existing Commission-approved tariffs and (2) is in good standing with the interconnection and construction requirements applicable to the applicant's service request. Provides that electric utilities shall not delay investment to support, provide service, or interconnect large demand project applicants as a result of the changes made by the amendatory provisions. Provides that the amendatory provisions shall not be construed to limit the following: (1) a utility's enforcement of Commission-approved technical standards for interconnection, (2) a utility's enforcement of reasonable milestones for construction progress, and (3) a utility's ability to recover all costs prudently and reasonably incurred. Provides that the amendatory provisions are inoperative September 1, 2026. Defines "large demand project applicant". Effective immediately.LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b  A BILL FOR HB4172LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1    AN ACT concerning regulation. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Findings; intent.5    (a) The General Assembly finds that substantial security 6deposits as a condition of interconnection or service for 7large demand project applicants unreasonably deter new 8investment and delay construction of facilities that otherwise 9comply with existing interconnection and tariff requirements.10    (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to promote 11economic development and attract investment in advanced 12manufacturing and digital infrastructure, including 13large-scale data centers. 14    (b) The changes made by this amendatory Act of the 104th 15General Assembly are intended to provide temporary relief to 16large demand project applicants until the General Assembly and 17the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission implement policies 18regarding utility deposit practices and transmission service 19agreements, respectively. 20    (c) This amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly is 21not intended to delay the interconnection or service of large 22demand project applicants. 23    Section 5. The Public Utilities Act is amended by changing   HB4172- 2 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1Section 16-108 as follows: 2    (220 ILCS 5/16-108)3    Sec. 16-108. Recovery of costs associated with the 4provision of delivery and other services.5    (a) An electric utility shall file a delivery services 6tariff with the Commission at least 210 days prior to the date 7that it is required to begin offering such services pursuant 8to this Act. An electric utility shall provide the components 9of delivery services that are subject to the jurisdiction of 10the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission at the same prices, 11terms and conditions set forth in its applicable tariff as 12approved or allowed into effect by that Commission. The 13Commission shall otherwise have the authority pursuant to 14Article IX to review, approve, and modify the prices, terms 15and conditions of those components of delivery services not 16subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory 17Commission, including the authority to determine the extent to 18which such delivery services should be offered on an unbundled 19basis. In making any such determination the Commission shall 20consider, at a minimum, the effect of additional unbundling on 21(i) the objective of just and reasonable rates, (ii) electric 22utility employees, and (iii) the development of competitive 23markets for electric energy services in Illinois.24    (b) The Commission shall enter an order approving, or 25approving as modified, the delivery services tariff no later   HB4172- 3 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1than 30 days prior to the date on which the electric utility 2must commence offering such services. The Commission may 3subsequently modify such tariff pursuant to this Act.4    (c) The electric utility's tariffs shall define the 5classes of its customers for purposes of delivery services 6charges. Delivery services shall be priced and made available 7to all retail customers electing delivery services in each 8such class on a nondiscriminatory basis regardless of whether 9the retail customer chooses the electric utility, an affiliate 10of the electric utility, or another entity as its supplier of 11electric power and energy. Charges for delivery services shall 12be cost based, and shall allow the electric utility to recover 13the costs of providing delivery services through its charges 14to its delivery service customers that use the facilities and 15services associated with such costs. Such costs shall include 16the costs of owning, operating and maintaining transmission 17and distribution facilities. The Commission shall also be 18authorized to consider whether, and if so to what extent, the 19following costs are appropriately included in the electric 20utility's delivery services rates: (i) the costs of that 21portion of generation facilities used for the production and 22absorption of reactive power in order that retail customers 23located in the electric utility's service area can receive 24electric power and energy from suppliers other than the 25electric utility, and (ii) the costs associated with the use 26and redispatch of generation facilities to mitigate   HB4172- 4 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1constraints on the transmission or distribution system in 2order that retail customers located in the electric utility's 3service area can receive electric power and energy from 4suppliers other than the electric utility. Nothing in this 5subsection shall be construed as directing the Commission to 6allocate any of the costs described in (i) or (ii) that are 7found to be appropriately included in the electric utility's 8delivery services rates to any particular customer group or 9geographic area in setting delivery services rates.10    (d) The Commission shall establish charges, terms and 11conditions for delivery services that are just and reasonable 12and shall take into account customer impacts when establishing 13such charges. In establishing charges, terms and conditions 14for delivery services, the Commission shall take into account 15voltage level differences. A retail customer shall have the 16option to request to purchase electric service at any delivery 17service voltage reasonably and technically feasible from the 18electric facilities serving that customer's premises provided 19that there are no significant adverse impacts upon system 20reliability or system efficiency. A retail customer shall also 21have the option to request to purchase electric service at any 22point of delivery that is reasonably and technically feasible 23provided that there are no significant adverse impacts on 24system reliability or efficiency. Such requests shall not be 25unreasonably denied.26    (e) Electric utilities shall recover the costs of   HB4172- 5 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1installing, operating or maintaining facilities for the 2particular benefit of one or more delivery services customers, 3including without limitation any costs incurred in complying 4with a customer's request to be served at a different voltage 5level, directly from the retail customer or customers for 6whose benefit the costs were incurred, to the extent such 7costs are not recovered through the charges referred to in 8subsections (c) and (d) of this Section.9    (e-5) Notwithstanding any provision of this Act, an 10electric utility shall not require or collect a security 11deposit, a cash deposit, a letter of credit, an advance 12payment, or any other equivalent financial assurance from a 13large demand project applicant who submits a service or 14interconnection request if that applicant (1) submitted an 15application for interconnection or service under existing 16Commission-approved tariffs and (2) is in good standing with 17the interconnection and construction requirements applicable 18to the applicant's service request.19    An electric utility shall not delay investment to support, 20provide service, or interconnect large demand project 21applicants as a result of the changes made by this amendatory 22Act of the 104th General Assembly. Nothing in this subsection 23(e-5) shall be construed to limit the following:24        (1) a utility's enforcement of Commission-approved 25    technical standards for interconnection;26        (2) a utility's enforcement of reasonable milestones   HB4172- 6 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1    for construction progress; and2        (3) a utility's ability to recover all costs prudently 3    and reasonably incurred.4    This amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly shall 5preempt and supersede any final Commission orders entered in 6Docket Nos. 25-677, 25-679, and any other applicable Docket, 7to the extent the orders are inconsistent with this subsection 8(e-5). 9    As used in this subsection (e-5), "large demand project 10applicant" means an applicant or customer who requests a 11revised or new service or revised or new facilities for a 12project with a projected load of over 50 megawatts.13    The provisions of this subsection (e-5) are inoperative 14September 1, 2026. 15    (f) An electric utility shall be entitled but not required 16to implement transition charges in conjunction with the 17offering of delivery services pursuant to Section 16-104. If 18an electric utility implements transition charges, it shall 19implement such charges for all delivery services customers and 20for all customers described in subsection (h), but shall not 21implement transition charges for power and energy that a 22retail customer takes from cogeneration or self-generation 23facilities located on that retail customer's premises, if such 24facilities meet the following criteria: 25        (i) the cogeneration or self-generation facilities 26    serve a single retail customer and are located on that   HB4172- 7 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1    retail customer's premises (for purposes of this 2    subparagraph and subparagraph (ii), an industrial or 3    manufacturing retail customer and a third party contractor 4    that is served by such industrial or manufacturing 5    customer through such retail customer's own electrical 6    distribution facilities under the circumstances described 7    in subsection (vi) of the definition of "alternative 8    retail electric supplier" set forth in Section 16-102, 9    shall be considered a single retail customer); 10        (ii) the cogeneration or self-generation facilities 11    either (A) are sized pursuant to generally accepted 12    engineering standards for the retail customer's electrical 13    load at that premises (taking into account standby or 14    other reliability considerations related to that retail 15    customer's operations at that site) or (B) if the facility 16    is a cogeneration facility located on the retail 17    customer's premises, the retail customer is the thermal 18    host for that facility and the facility has been designed 19    to meet that retail customer's thermal energy requirements 20    resulting in electrical output beyond that retail 21    customer's electrical demand at that premises, comply with 22    the operating and efficiency standards applicable to 23    "qualifying facilities" specified in title 18 Code of 24    Federal Regulations Section 292.205 as in effect on the 25    effective date of this amendatory Act of 1999; 26        (iii) the retail customer on whose premises the   HB4172- 8 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1    facilities are located either has an exclusive right to 2    receive, and corresponding obligation to pay for, all of 3    the electrical capacity of the facility, or in the case of 4    a cogeneration facility that has been designed to meet the 5    retail customer's thermal energy requirements at that 6    premises, an identified amount of the electrical capacity 7    of the facility, over a minimum 5-year period; and 8        (iv) if the cogeneration facility is sized for the 9    retail customer's thermal load at that premises but 10    exceeds the electrical load, any sales of excess power or 11    energy are made only at wholesale, are subject to the 12    jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 13    and are not for the purpose of circumventing the 14    provisions of this subsection (f).15If a generation facility located at a retail customer's 16premises does not meet the above criteria, an electric utility 17implementing transition charges shall implement a transition 18charge until December 31, 2006 for any power and energy taken 19by such retail customer from such facility as if such power and 20energy had been delivered by the electric utility. Provided, 21however, that an industrial retail customer that is taking 22power from a generation facility that does not meet the above 23criteria but that is located on such customer's premises will 24not be subject to a transition charge for the power and energy 25taken by such retail customer from such generation facility if 26the facility does not serve any other retail customer and   HB4172- 9 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1either was installed on behalf of the customer and for its own 2use prior to January 1, 1997, or is both predominantly fueled 3by byproducts of such customer's manufacturing process at such 4premises and sells or offers an average of 300 megawatts or 5more of electricity produced from such generation facility 6into the wholesale market. Such charges shall be calculated as 7provided in Section 16-102, and shall be collected on each 8kilowatt-hour delivered under a delivery services tariff to a 9retail customer from the date the customer first takes 10delivery services until December 31, 2006 except as provided 11in subsection (h) of this Section. Provided, however, that an 12electric utility, other than an electric utility providing 13service to at least 1,000,000 customers in this State on 14January 1, 1999, shall be entitled to petition for entry of an 15order by the Commission authorizing the electric utility to 16implement transition charges for an additional period ending 17no later than December 31, 2008. The electric utility shall 18file its petition with supporting evidence no earlier than 16 19months, and no later than 12 months, prior to December 31, 202006. The Commission shall hold a hearing on the electric 21utility's petition and shall enter its order no later than 8 22months after the petition is filed. The Commission shall 23determine whether and to what extent the electric utility 24shall be authorized to implement transition charges for an 25additional period. The Commission may authorize the electric 26utility to implement transition charges for some or all of the   HB4172- 10 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1additional period, and shall determine the mitigation factors 2to be used in implementing such transition charges; provided, 3that the Commission shall not authorize mitigation factors 4less than 110% of those in effect during the 12 months ended 5December 31, 2006. In making its determination, the Commission 6shall consider the following factors: the necessity to 7implement transition charges for an additional period in order 8to maintain the financial integrity of the electric utility; 9the prudence of the electric utility's actions in reducing its 10costs since the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1997; 11the ability of the electric utility to provide safe, adequate 12and reliable service to retail customers in its service area; 13and the impact on competition of allowing the electric utility 14to implement transition charges for the additional period.15    (g) The electric utility shall file tariffs that establish 16the transition charges to be paid by each class of customers to 17the electric utility in conjunction with the provision of 18delivery services. The electric utility's tariffs shall define 19the classes of its customers for purposes of calculating 20transition charges. The electric utility's tariffs shall 21provide for the calculation of transition charges on a 22customer-specific basis for any retail customer whose average 23monthly maximum electrical demand on the electric utility's 24system during the 6 months with the customer's highest monthly 25maximum electrical demands equals or exceeds 3.0 megawatts for 26electric utilities having more than 1,000,000 customers, and   HB4172- 11 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1for other electric utilities for any customer that has an 2average monthly maximum electrical demand on the electric 3utility's system of one megawatt or more, and (A) for which 4there exists data on the customer's usage during the 3 years 5preceding the date that the customer became eligible to take 6delivery services, or (B) for which there does not exist data 7on the customer's usage during the 3 years preceding the date 8that the customer became eligible to take delivery services, 9if in the electric utility's reasonable judgment there exists 10comparable usage information or a sufficient basis to develop 11such information, and further provided that the electric 12utility can require customers for which an individual 13calculation is made to sign contracts that set forth the 14transition charges to be paid by the customer to the electric 15utility pursuant to the tariff.16    (h) An electric utility shall also be entitled to file 17tariffs that allow it to collect transition charges from 18retail customers in the electric utility's service area that 19do not take delivery services but that take electric power or 20energy from an alternative retail electric supplier or from an 21electric utility other than the electric utility in whose 22service area the customer is located. Such charges shall be 23calculated, in accordance with the definition of transition 24charges in Section 16-102, for the period of time that the 25customer would be obligated to pay transition charges if it 26were taking delivery services, except that no deduction for   HB4172- 12 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1delivery services revenues shall be made in such calculation, 2and usage data from the customer's class shall be used where 3historical usage data is not available for the individual 4customer. The customer shall be obligated to pay such charges 5on a lump sum basis on or before the date on which the customer 6commences to take service from the alternative retail electric 7supplier or other electric utility, provided, that the 8electric utility in whose service area the customer is located 9shall offer the customer the option of signing a contract 10pursuant to which the customer pays such charges ratably over 11the period in which the charges would otherwise have applied.12    (i) An electric utility shall be entitled to add to the 13bills of delivery services customers charges pursuant to 14Sections 9-221, 9-222 (except as provided in Section 9-222.1), 15and Section 16-114 of this Act, Section 5-5 of the Electricity 16Infrastructure Maintenance Fee Law, Section 6-5 of the 17Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, and Coal Resources 18Development Law of 1997, and Section 13 of the Energy 19Assistance Act.20    (i-5) An electric utility required to impose the Coal to 21Solar and Energy Storage Initiative Charge provided for in 22subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency 23Act shall add such charge to the bills of its delivery services 24customers pursuant to the terms of a tariff conforming to the 25requirements of subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the 26Illinois Power Agency Act and this subsection (i-5) and filed   HB4172- 13 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1with and approved by the Commission. The electric utility 2shall file its proposed tariff with the Commission on or 3before July 1, 2022 to be effective, after review and approval 4or modification by the Commission, beginning January 1, 2023. 5On or before December 1, 2022, the Commission shall review the 6electric utility's proposed tariff, including by conducting a 7docketed proceeding if deemed necessary by the Commission, and 8shall approve the proposed tariff or direct the electric 9utility to make modifications the Commission finds necessary 10for the tariff to conform to the requirements of subsection 11(c-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act and this 12subsection (i-5). The electric utility's tariff shall provide 13for imposition of the Coal to Solar and Energy Storage 14Initiative Charge on a per-kilowatthour basis to all 15kilowatthours delivered by the electric utility to its 16delivery services customers. The tariff shall provide for the 17calculation of the Coal to Solar and Energy Storage Initiative 18Charge to be in effect for the year beginning January 1, 2023 19and each year beginning January 1 thereafter, sufficient to 20collect the electric utility's estimated payment obligations 21for the delivery year beginning the following June 1 under 22contracts for purchase of renewable energy credits entered 23into pursuant to subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the 24Illinois Power Agency Act and the obligations of the 25Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, or any 26successor department or agency, which for purposes of this   HB4172- 14 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1subsection (i-5) shall be referred to as the Department, to 2make grant payments during such delivery year from the Coal to 3Solar and Energy Storage Initiative Fund pursuant to grant 4contracts entered into pursuant to subsection (c-5) of Section 51-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, and using the electric 6utility's kilowatthour deliveries to its delivery services 7customers during the delivery year ended May 31 of the 8preceding calendar year.

Notwithstanding the 25date on which the utility places such new tariffed charges 26into effect, the utility shall be permitted to collect the   HB4172- 19 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1charges under such tariff as if the tariff had been in effect 2beginning with the first day of the June 2017 monthly billing 3period. For the delivery years commencing June 1, 2017, June 41, 2018, June 1, 2019, and each delivery year thereafter, the 5electric utility shall deposit into a separate interest 6bearing account of a financial institution the monies 7collected under the tariffed charges. Money collected from 8customers for the procurement of renewable energy resources in 9a given delivery year may be spent by the utility for the 10procurement of renewable resources over any of the following 5 11delivery years, after which unspent money shall be credited 12back to retail customers. The electric utility shall spend all 13money collected in earlier delivery years that has not yet 14been returned to customers, first, before spending money 15collected in later delivery years. Any interest earned shall 16be credited back to retail customers under the reconciliation 17proceeding provided for in this subsection (k), provided that 18the electric utility shall first be reimbursed from the 19interest for the administrative costs that it incurs to 20administer and manage the account. Any taxes due on the funds 21in the account, or interest earned on it, will be paid from the 22account or, if insufficient monies are available in the 23account, from the monies collected under the tariffed charges 24to recover the costs of procuring renewable energy resources. 25Monies deposited in the account shall be subject to the 26review, reconciliation, and true-up process described in this   HB4172- 20 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1subsection (k) that is applicable to the funds collected and 2costs incurred for the procurement of renewable energy 3resources.4    The electric utility shall be entitled to recover all of 5the costs identified in this subsection (k) through automatic 6adjustment clause tariffs applicable to all of the utility's 7retail customers that allow the electric utility to adjust its 8tariffed charges consistent with this subsection (k). The 9determination as to whether any excess funds were collected 10during a given delivery year for the purchase of renewable 11energy resources, and the crediting of any excess funds back 12to retail customers, shall not be made until after the close of 13the delivery year, which will ensure that the maximum amount 14of funds is available to implement the approved long-term 15renewable resources procurement plan during a given delivery 16year. The amount of excess funds eligible to be credited back 17to retail customers shall be reduced by an amount equal to the 18payment obligations required by any contracts entered into by 19an electric utility under contracts described in subsection 20(b) of Section 1-56 and subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of the 21Illinois Power Agency Act, even if such payments have not yet 22been made and regardless of the delivery year in which those 23payment obligations were incurred. Notwithstanding anything to 24the contrary, including in tariffs authorized by this 25subsection (k) in effect before the effective date of this 26amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, all unspent   HB4172- 21 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1funds as of May 31, 2021, excluding any funds credited to 2customers during any utility billing cycle that commences 3prior to the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd 4General Assembly, shall remain in the utility account and 5shall on a first in, first out basis be used toward utility 6payment obligations under contracts described in subsection 7(b) of Section 1-56 and subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of the 8Illinois Power Agency Act. The electric utility's collections 9under such automatic adjustment clause tariffs to recover the 10costs of renewable energy resources, zero emission credits 11from zero emission facilities, and carbon mitigation credits 12from carbon-free energy resources shall be subject to separate 13annual review, reconciliation, and true-up against actual 14costs by the Commission under a procedure that shall be 15specified in the electric utility's automatic adjustment 16clause tariffs and that shall be approved by the Commission in 17connection with its approval of such tariffs. The procedure 18shall provide that any difference between the electric 19utility's collections for zero emission credits and carbon 20mitigation credits under the automatic adjustment charges for 21an annual period and the electric utility's actual costs of 22zero emission credits from zero emission facilities and carbon 23mitigation credits from carbon-free energy resources for that 24same annual period shall be refunded to or collected from, as 25applicable, the electric utility's retail customers in 26subsequent periods.  HB4172- 22 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1    Nothing in this subsection (k) is intended to affect, 2limit, or change the right of the electric utility to recover 3the costs associated with the procurement of renewable energy 4resources for periods commencing before, on, or after June 1, 52017, as otherwise provided in the Illinois Power Agency Act. 6    The funding available under this subsection (k), if any, 7for the programs described under subsection (b) of Section 81-56 of the Illinois Power Agency Act shall not reduce the 9amount of funding for the programs described in subparagraph 10(O) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of the 11Illinois Power Agency Act. If funding is available under this 12subsection (k) for programs described under subsection (b) of 13Section 1-56 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, then the 14long-term renewable resources plan shall provide for the 15Agency to procure contracts in an amount that does not exceed 16the funding, and the contracts approved by the Commission 17shall be executed by the applicable utility or utilities. 18    (l) A utility that has terminated any contract executed 19under subsection (d-5) or (d-10) of Section 1-75 of the 20Illinois Power Agency Act shall be entitled to recover any 21remaining balance associated with the purchase of zero 22emission credits prior to such termination, and such utility 23shall also apply a credit to its retail customer bills in the 24event of any over-collection. 25    (m)(1) An electric utility that recovers its costs of 26procuring zero emission credits from zero emission facilities   HB4172- 23 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1through a cents-per-kilowatthour charge under subsection (k) 2of this Section shall be subject to the requirements of this 3subsection (m). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, such 4electric utility shall, beginning on April 30, 2018, and each 5April 30 thereafter until April 30, 2026, calculate whether 6any reduction must be applied to such cents-per-kilowatthour 7charge that is paid by retail customers of the electric 8utility that have opted out of subsections (a) through (j) of 9Section 8-103B of this Act under subsection (l) of Section 108-103B. Such charge shall be reduced for such customers for 11the next delivery year commencing on June 1 based on the amount 12necessary, if any, to limit the annual estimated average net 13increase for the prior calendar year due to the future energy 14investment costs to no more than 1.3% of 5.98 cents per 15kilowatt-hour, which is the average amount paid per 16kilowatthour for electric service during the year ending 17December 31, 2015 by Illinois industrial retail customers, as 18reported to the Edison Electric Institute. 19    The calculations required by this subsection (m) shall be 20made only once for each year, and no subsequent rate impact 21determinations shall be made. 22    (2) For purposes of this Section, "future energy 23investment costs" shall be calculated by subtracting the 24cents-per-kilowatthour charge identified in subparagraph (A) 25of this paragraph (2) from the sum of the 26cents-per-kilowatthour charges identified in subparagraph (B)   HB4172- 24 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1of this paragraph (2): 2        (A) The cents-per-kilowatthour charge identified in 3    the electric utility's tariff placed into effect under 4    Section 8-103 of the Public Utilities Act that, on 5    December 1, 2016, was applicable to those retail customers 6    that have opted out of subsections (a) through (j) of 7    Section 8-103B of this Act under subsection (l) of Section 8    8-103B. 9        (B) The sum of the following cents-per-kilowatthour 10    charges applicable to those retail customers that have 11    opted out of subsections (a) through (j) of Section 8-103B 12    of this Act under subsection (l) of Section 8-103B, 13    provided that if one or more of the following charges has 14    been in effect and applied to such customers for more than 15    one calendar year, then each charge shall be equal to the 16    average of the charges applied over a period that 17    commences with the calendar year ending December 31, 2017 18    and ends with the most recently completed calendar year 19    prior to the calculation required by this subsection (m): 20            (i) the cents-per-kilowatthour charge to recover 21        the costs incurred by the utility under subsection 22        (d-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency 23        Act, adjusted for any reductions required under this 24        subsection (m); and25            (ii) the cents-per-kilowatthour charge to recover 26        the costs incurred by the utility under Section   HB4172- 25 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1        16-107.6 of the Public Utilities Act. 2        If no charge was applied for a given calendar year 3    under item (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph (B), then the 4    value of the charge for that year shall be zero. 5    (3) If a reduction is required by the calculation 6performed under this subsection (m), then the amount of the 7reduction shall be multiplied by the number of years reflected 8in the averages calculated under subparagraph (B) of paragraph 9(2) of this subsection (m). Such reduction shall be applied to 10the cents-per-kilowatthour charge that is applicable to those 11retail customers that have opted out of subsections (a) 12through (j) of Section 8-103B of this Act under subsection (l) 13of Section 8-103B beginning with the next delivery year 14commencing after the date of the calculation required by this 15subsection (m). 16    (4) The electric utility shall file a notice with the 17Commission on May 1 of 2018 and each May 1 thereafter until May 181, 2026 containing the reduction, if any, which must be 19applied for the delivery year which begins in the year of the 20filing. The notice shall contain the calculations made 21pursuant to this Section. By October 1 of each year beginning 22in 2018, each electric utility shall notify the Commission if 23it appears, based on an estimate of the calculation required 24in this subsection (m), that a reduction will be required in 25the next year. 26(Source: P.A. 102-662, eff. 9-15-21.)   HB4172- 26 -LRB104 15952 AAS 29187 b1    Section 99.
