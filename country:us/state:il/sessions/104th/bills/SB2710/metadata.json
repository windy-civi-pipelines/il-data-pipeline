      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act. Requires the Department of Healthcare and Family Services, in consultation with the Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts, to conduct a comprehensive study on parenting-time presumptions in child custody proceedings. Provides that the study examine how statutory presumptions and judicial practices affect fairness, parental involvement, and child outcomes in custody cases. Requires that the review pay particular attention to ensuring that both parents, regardless of gender, are given equitable opportunities to maintain meaningful relationships with their children. Requires that the Department submit a final report to the General Assembly and the Governor no later than December 31, 2026 and include findings, recommendations, and potential statutory language to update Illinois law. Repeals the Act on December 31, 2027."
