      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Insurance Code. Provides that no insurance company that is authorized to do business in the State and that issues policies for personal multiperil property coverage, commonly known as homeowners insurance, shall use premiums collected from policyholders for executive employee compensation and bonuses, including, but not limited to, Chief Executive Officer stock buy-backs; any marketing materials, including, but not limited to, any print, radio, television, electronic, or digital advertisements; costs associated with lobbying; and contributions to State candidates for elected office, federal candidates for elected office, or political committees. Provides that, if an insurer that sells homeowner insurance policies in the State cancels or refuses to renew a policyholder's insurance policy or if, upon renewal, a policyholder's premium will increase by 10% or more, the insurer shall automatically provide a written notice to the policyholder disclosing the causes of any policy cancellation, non-renewal, or premium increase. Sets forth requirements for the content of the required notice. Provides that an insurer shall, within a reasonable time after providing notice to a policyholder, file electronically with the Department of Insurance a copy of the notice and any supporting documentation provided to the policyholder. Provides that, on or before July 1, 2026, the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity shall establish a homeowners and renters insurance affordability assistance pilot program.
