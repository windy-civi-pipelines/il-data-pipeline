In awarding racing 7dates under this subsection (e-2), the Board shall have the 8discretion to allocate those thoroughbred racing dates among 9these Cook County organization licensees.10    (e-3) In awarding racing dates for calendar year 2020 and 11thereafter in connection with a racetrack in Madison County, 12the Board shall award racing dates and such organization 13licensee shall run at least 700 thoroughbred races at the 14racetrack in Madison County each year. 15    Notwithstanding Section 7.7 of the Illinois Gambling Act 16or any provision of this Act other than subsection (e-4.5), 17for each calendar year for which an organization gaming 18licensee located in Madison County requests racing dates 19resulting in less than 700 live thoroughbred races at its 20racetrack facility, the organization gaming licensee may not 21conduct gaming pursuant to an organization gaming license 22issued under the Illinois Gambling Act for the calendar year 23of such requested live races. 24    (e-4) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.7 of the 25Illinois Gambling Act or any provision of this Act other than 26subsections (e-3) and (e-4.5), for each calendar year for   10400SB1473sam002- 21 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1which an organization gaming licensee requests thoroughbred 2racing dates which results in a number of live races under its 3organization license that is less than the total number of 4live races which it conducted in 2017 at its racetrack 5facility, the organization gaming licensee may not conduct 6gaming pursuant to its organization gaming license for the 7calendar year of such requested live races. 8    (e-4.1) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.7 of 9the Illinois Gambling Act or any provision of this Act other 10than subsections (e-3) and (e-4.5), for each calendar year for 11which an organization licensee requests racing dates for 12standardbred racing which results in a number of live races 13that is less than the total number of live races required in 14subsection (e-1), the organization gaming licensee may not 15conduct gaming pursuant to its organization gaming license for 16the calendar year of such requested live races. 17    (e-4.5) The Board shall award the minimum live racing 18guarantees contained in subsections (e-1), (e-2), and (e-3) to 19ensure that each organization licensee shall individually run 20a sufficient number of races per year to qualify for an 21organization gaming license under this Act. The General 22Assembly finds that the minimum live racing guarantees 23contained in subsections (e-1), (e-2), and (e-3) are in the 24best interest of the sport of horse racing, and that such 25guarantees may only be reduced in the calendar year in which 26they will be conducted in the limited circumstances described   10400SB1473sam002- 22 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1in this subsection. The Board may decrease the number of 2racing days without affecting an organization licensee's 3ability to conduct gaming pursuant to an organization gaming 4license issued under the Illinois Gambling Act only if the 5Board determines, after notice and hearing, that: 6        (i) a decrease is necessary to maintain a sufficient 7    number of betting interests per race to ensure the 8    integrity of racing; 9        (ii) there are unsafe track conditions due to weather 10    or acts of God;11        (iii) there is an agreement between an organization 12    licensee and the breed association that is applicable to 13    the involved live racing guarantee, such association 14    representing either the largest number of thoroughbred 15    owners and trainers or the largest number of standardbred 16    owners, trainers and drivers who race horses at the 17    involved organization licensee's racing meeting, so long 18    as the agreement does not compromise the integrity of the 19    sport of horse racing; or20        (iv) the horse population or purse levels are 21    insufficient to provide the number of racing opportunities 22    otherwise required in this Act. 23    In decreasing the number of racing dates in accordance 24with this subsection, the Board shall hold a hearing and shall 25provide the public and all interested parties notice and an 26opportunity to be heard. The Board shall accept testimony from   10400SB1473sam002- 23 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1all interested parties, including any association representing 2owners, trainers, jockeys, or drivers who will be affected by 3the decrease in racing dates. The Board shall provide a 4written explanation of the reasons for the decrease and the 5Board's findings. The written explanation shall include a 6listing and content of all communication between any party and 7any Illinois Racing Board member or staff that does not take 8place at a public meeting of the Board. 9    (e-5) In reviewing an application for the purpose of 10granting an organization license consistent with the best 11interests of the public and the sport of horse racing, the 12Board shall consider: 13        (1) the character, reputation, experience, and 14    financial integrity of the applicant and of any other 15    separate person that either: 16            (i) controls the applicant, directly or 17        indirectly, or 18            (ii) is controlled, directly or indirectly, by 19        that applicant or by a person who controls, directly 20        or indirectly, that applicant; 21        (2) the applicant's facilities or proposed facilities 22    for conducting horse racing; 23        (3) the total revenue without regard to Section 32.1 24    to be derived by the State and horsemen from the 25    applicant's conducting a race meeting; 26        (4) the applicant's good faith affirmative action plan   10400SB1473sam002- 24 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1    to recruit, train, and upgrade minorities in all 2    employment classifications; 3        (5) the applicant's financial ability to purchase and 4    maintain adequate liability and casualty insurance; 5        (6) the applicant's proposed and prior year's 6    promotional and marketing activities and expenditures of 7    the applicant associated with those activities; 8        (7) an agreement, if any, among organization licensees 9    as provided in subsection (b) of Section 21 of this Act; 10    and 11        (8) the extent to which the applicant exceeds or meets 12    other standards for the issuance of an organization 13    license that the Board shall adopt by rule.14    In granting organization licenses and allocating dates for 15horse race meetings, the Board shall have discretion to 16determine an overall schedule, including required simulcasts 17of Illinois races by host tracks that will, in its judgment, be 18conducive to the best interests of the public and the sport of 19horse racing.20    (e-10) The Illinois Administrative Procedure Act shall 21apply to administrative procedures of the Board under this Act 22for the granting of an organization license, except that (1) 23notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of Section 2410-40 of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act regarding 25cross-examination, the Board may prescribe rules limiting the 26right of an applicant or participant in any proceeding to   10400SB1473sam002- 25 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1award an organization license to conduct cross-examination of 2witnesses at that proceeding where that cross-examination 3would unduly obstruct the timely award of an organization 4license under subsection (e) of Section 20 of this Act; (2) the 5provisions of Section 10-45 of the Illinois Administrative 6Procedure Act regarding proposals for decision are excluded 7under this Act; (3) notwithstanding the provisions of 8subsection (a) of Section 10-60 of the Illinois Administrative 9Procedure Act regarding ex parte communications, the Board may 10prescribe rules allowing ex parte communications with 11applicants or participants in a proceeding to award an 12organization license where conducting those communications 13would be in the best interest of racing, provided all those 14communications are made part of the record of that proceeding 15pursuant to subsection (c) of Section 10-60 of the Illinois 16Administrative Procedure Act; (4) the provisions of Section 1714a of this Act and the rules of the Board promulgated under 18that Section shall apply instead of the provisions of Article 1910 of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act regarding 20administrative law judges; and (5) the provisions of 21subsection (d) of Section 10-65 of the Illinois Administrative 22Procedure Act that prevent summary suspension of a license 23pending revocation or other action shall not apply.24    (f) The Board may allot racing dates to an organization 25licensee for more than one calendar year but for no more than 3 26successive calendar years in advance, provided that the Board   10400SB1473sam002- 26 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1shall review such allotment for more than one calendar year 2prior to each year for which such allotment has been made. The 3granting of an organization license to a person constitutes a 4privilege to conduct a horse race meeting under the provisions 5of this Act, and no person granted an organization license 6shall be deemed to have a vested interest, property right, or 7future expectation to receive an organization license in any 8subsequent year as a result of the granting of an organization 9license. Organization licenses shall be subject to revocation 10if the organization licensee has violated any provision of 11this Act or the rules and regulations promulgated under this 12Act or has been convicted of a crime or has failed to disclose 13or has stated falsely any information called for in the 14application for an organization license. Any organization 15license revocation proceeding shall be in accordance with 16Section 16 regarding suspension and revocation of occupation 17licenses.18    (f-5) If, (i) an applicant does not file an acceptance of 19the racing dates awarded by the Board as required under part 20(1) of subsection (h) of this Section 20, or (ii) an 21organization licensee has its license suspended or revoked 22under this Act, the Board, upon conducting an emergency 23hearing as provided for in this Act, may reaward on an 24emergency basis pursuant to rules established by the Board, 25racing dates not accepted or the racing dates associated with 26any suspension or revocation period to one or more   10400SB1473sam002- 27 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1organization licensees, new applicants, or any combination 2thereof, upon terms and conditions that the Board determines 3are in the best interest of racing, provided, the organization 4licensees or new applicants receiving the awarded racing dates 5file an acceptance of those reawarded racing dates as required 6under paragraph (1) of subsection (h) of this Section 20 and 7comply with the other provisions of this Act. The Illinois 8Administrative Procedure Act shall not apply to the 9administrative procedures of the Board in conducting the 10emergency hearing and the reallocation of racing dates on an 11emergency basis.12    (g) (Blank).13    (h) The Board shall send the applicant a copy of its 14formally executed order by certified mail addressed to the 15applicant at the address stated in his application, which 16notice shall be mailed within 5 days of the date the formal 17order is executed.18    Each applicant notified shall, within 10 days after 19receipt of the final executed order of the Board awarding 20racing dates: 21        (1) file with the Board an acceptance of such award in 22    the form prescribed by the Board; 23        (2) pay to the Board an additional amount equal to 24    $110 for each racing date awarded; and 25        (3) file with the Board the bonds required in Sections 26    21 and 25 at least 20 days prior to the first day of each   10400SB1473sam002- 28 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1    race meeting.2Upon compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (1), (2), 3and (3) of this subsection (h), the applicant shall be issued 4an organization license.5    If any applicant fails to comply with this Section or 6fails to pay the organization license fees herein provided, no 7organization license shall be issued to such applicant.8(Source: P.A. 101-31, eff. 6-28-19.) 9    (230 ILCS 5/26)  (from Ch. 8, par. 37-26)10    Sec. 26. Wagering. 11    (a) Any licensee may conduct and supervise the pari-mutuel 12system of wagering, as defined in Section 3.12 of this Act, on 13horse races conducted by an Illinois organization licensee or 14conducted at a racetrack located in another state or country 15in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 26 of this Act. 16Subject to the prior consent of the Board, licensees may 17supplement any pari-mutuel pool in order to guarantee a 18minimum distribution. Such pari-mutuel method of wagering 19shall not, under any circumstances if conducted under the 20provisions of this Act, be held or construed to be unlawful, 21other statutes of this State to the contrary notwithstanding. 22Subject to rules for advance wagering promulgated by the 23Board, any licensee may accept wagers in advance of the day the 24race wagered upon occurs.25    (b) Except for those gaming activities for which a license   10400SB1473sam002- 29 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1is obtained and authorized under the Illinois Lottery Law, the 2Charitable Games Act, the Raffles and Poker Runs Act, the 3Video Gaming Act, or the Illinois Gambling Act, no other 4method of betting, pool making, wagering or gambling shall be 5used or permitted by the licensee. Each licensee may retain, 6subject to the payment of all applicable taxes and purses, an 7amount not to exceed 17% of all money wagered under subsection 8(a) of this Section, except as may otherwise be permitted 9under this Act.10    (b-5) An individual may place a wager under the 11pari-mutuel system from any licensed location authorized under 12this Act provided that wager is electronically recorded in the 13manner described in Section 3.12 of this Act. Any wager made 14electronically by an individual while physically on the 15premises of a licensee shall be deemed to have been made at the 16premises of that licensee.17    (c) (Blank).18    (c-5) The sum held by any licensee for payment of 19outstanding pari-mutuel tickets, if unclaimed prior to 20December 31 of the next year, shall be retained by the licensee 21for payment of such tickets until that date. Within 10 days 22thereafter, the balance of such sum remaining unclaimed, less 23any uncashed supplements contributed by such licensee for the 24purpose of guaranteeing minimum distributions of any 25pari-mutuel pool, shall be evenly distributed to the purse 26account of the organization licensee and the organization   10400SB1473sam002- 30 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1licensee, except that the balance of the sum of all 2outstanding pari-mutuel tickets generated from simulcast 3wagering and inter-track wagering by an organization licensee 4located in a county with a population in excess of 230,000 and 5borders the Mississippi River or any licensee that derives its 6license from that organization licensee shall be evenly 7distributed to the purse account of the organization licensee 8and the organization licensee.9    (d) A pari-mutuel ticket shall be honored until December 1031 of the next calendar year, and the licensee shall pay the 11same and may charge the amount thereof against unpaid money 12similarly accumulated on account of pari-mutuel tickets not 13presented for payment.14    (e) No licensee shall knowingly permit any minor, other 15than an employee of such licensee or an owner, trainer, 16jockey, driver, or employee thereof, to be admitted during a 17racing program unless accompanied by a parent or guardian, or 18any minor to be a patron of the pari-mutuel system of wagering 19conducted or supervised by it. The admission of any 20unaccompanied minor, other than an employee of the licensee or 21an owner, trainer, jockey, driver, or employee thereof at a 22race track is a Class C misdemeanor.23    (f) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Act, an 24organization licensee may contract with an entity in another 25state or country to permit any legal wagering entity in 26another state or country to accept wagers solely within such   10400SB1473sam002- 31 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1other state or country on races conducted by the organization 2licensee in this State. Beginning January 1, 2000, these 3wagers shall not be subject to State taxation. Until January 41, 2000, when the out-of-State entity conducts a pari-mutuel 5pool separate from the organization licensee, a privilege tax 6equal to 7 1/2% of all monies received by the organization 7licensee from entities in other states or countries pursuant 8to such contracts is imposed on the organization licensee, and 9such privilege tax shall be remitted to the Department of 10Revenue within 48 hours of receipt of the moneys from the 11simulcast. When the out-of-State entity conducts a combined 12pari-mutuel pool with the organization licensee, the tax shall 13be 10% of all monies received by the organization licensee 14with 25% of the receipts from this 10% tax to be distributed to 15the county in which the race was conducted.16    An organization licensee may permit one or more of its 17races to be utilized for pari-mutuel wagering at one or more 18locations in other states and may transmit audio and visual 19signals of races the organization licensee conducts to one or 20more locations outside the State or country and may also 21permit pari-mutuel pools in other states or countries to be 22combined with its gross or net wagering pools or with wagering 23pools established by other states.24    (g) A host track may accept interstate simulcast wagers on 25horse races conducted in other states or countries and shall 26control the number of signals and types of breeds of racing in   10400SB1473sam002- 32 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1its simulcast program, subject to the disapproval of the 2Board. The Board may prohibit a simulcast program only if it 3finds that the simulcast program is clearly adverse to the 4integrity of racing. The host track simulcast program shall 5include the signal of live racing of all organization 6licensees. All non-host licensees and advance deposit wagering 7licensees shall carry the signal of and accept wagers on live 8racing of all organization licensees. Advance deposit wagering 9licensees shall not be permitted to accept out-of-state wagers 10on any Illinois signal provided pursuant to this Section 11without the approval and consent of the organization licensee 12providing the signal. For one year after August 15, 2014 (the 13effective date of Public Act 98-968), non-host licensees may 14carry the host track simulcast program and shall accept wagers 15on all races included as part of the simulcast program of horse 16races conducted at race tracks located within North America 17upon which wagering is permitted. For a period of one year 18after August 15, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 1998-968), on horse races conducted at race tracks located 20outside of North America, non-host licensees may accept wagers 21on all races included as part of the simulcast program upon 22which wagering is permitted. Beginning August 15, 2015 (one 23year after the effective date of Public Act 98-968), non-host 24licensees may carry the host track simulcast program and shall 25accept wagers on all races included as part of the simulcast 26program upon which wagering is permitted. All organization   10400SB1473sam002- 33 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1licensees shall provide their live signal to all advance 2deposit wagering licensees for a simulcast commission fee not 3to exceed 6% of the advance deposit wagering licensee's 4Illinois handle on the organization licensee's signal without 5prior approval by the Board. The Board may adopt rules under 6which it may permit simulcast commission fees in excess of 6%. 7The Board shall adopt rules limiting the interstate commission 8fees charged to an advance deposit wagering licensee. The 9Board shall adopt rules regarding advance deposit wagering on 10interstate simulcast races that shall reflect, among other 11things, the General Assembly's desire to maximize revenues to 12the State, horsemen purses, and organization licensees. 13However, organization licensees providing live signals 14pursuant to the requirements of this subsection (g) may 15petition the Board to withhold their live signals from an 16advance deposit wagering licensee if the organization licensee 17discovers and the Board finds reputable or credible 18information that the advance deposit wagering licensee is 19under investigation by another state or federal governmental 20agency, the advance deposit wagering licensee's license has 21been suspended in another state, or the advance deposit 22wagering licensee's license is in revocation proceedings in 23another state. The organization licensee's provision of their 24live signal to an advance deposit wagering licensee under this 25subsection (g) pertains to wagers placed from within Illinois. 26Advance deposit wagering licensees may place advance deposit   10400SB1473sam002- 34 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1wagering terminals at wagering facilities as a convenience to 2customers. The advance deposit wagering licensee shall not 3charge or collect any fee from purses for the placement of the 4advance deposit wagering terminals. The costs and expenses of 5the host track and non-host licensees associated with 6interstate simulcast wagering, other than the interstate 7commission fee, shall be borne by the host track and all 8non-host licensees incurring these costs. The interstate 9commission fee shall not exceed 5% of Illinois handle on the 10interstate simulcast race or races without prior approval of 11the Board. The Board shall promulgate rules under which it may 12permit interstate commission fees in excess of 5%. The 13interstate commission fee and other fees charged by the 14sending racetrack, including, but not limited to, satellite 15decoder fees, shall be uniformly applied to the host track and 16all non-host licensees.17    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, an 18organization licensee, with the consent of the horsemen 19association representing the largest number of owners, 20trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race horses at 21that organization licensee's racing meeting, may maintain a 22system whereby advance deposit wagering may take place or an 23organization licensee, with the consent of the horsemen 24association representing the largest number of owners, 25trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race horses at 26that organization licensee's racing meeting, may contract with   10400SB1473sam002- 35 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1another person to carry out a system of advance deposit 2wagering. Such consent may not be unreasonably withheld. Only 3with respect to an appeal to the Board that consent for an 4organization licensee that maintains its own advance deposit 5wagering system is being unreasonably withheld, the Board 6shall issue a final order within 30 days after initiation of 7the appeal, and the organization licensee's advance deposit 8wagering system may remain operational during that 30-day 9period. The actions of any organization licensee who conducts 10advance deposit wagering or any person who has a contract with 11an organization licensee to conduct advance deposit wagering 12who conducts advance deposit wagering on or after January 1, 132013 and prior to June 7, 2013 (the effective date of Public 14Act 98-18) taken in reliance on the changes made to this 15subsection (g) by Public Act 98-18 are hereby validated, 16provided payment of all applicable pari-mutuel taxes are 17remitted to the Board. All advance deposit wagers placed from 18within Illinois must be placed through a Board-approved 19advance deposit wagering licensee; no other entity may accept 20an advance deposit wager from a person within Illinois. All 21advance deposit wagering is subject to any rules adopted by 22the Board. The Board may adopt rules necessary to regulate 23advance deposit wagering through the use of emergency 24rulemaking in accordance with Section 5-45 of the Illinois 25Administrative Procedure Act. The General Assembly finds that 26the adoption of rules to regulate advance deposit wagering is   10400SB1473sam002- 36 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1deemed an emergency and necessary for the public interest, 2safety, and welfare. An advance deposit wagering licensee may 3retain all moneys as agreed to by contract with an 4organization licensee. Any moneys retained by the organization 5licensee from advance deposit wagering, not including moneys 6retained by the advance deposit wagering licensee, shall be 7paid 50% to the organization licensee's purse account and 50% 8to the organization licensee. With the exception of any 9organization licensee that is owned by a publicly traded 10company that is incorporated in a state other than Illinois 11and advance deposit wagering licensees under contract with 12such organization licensees, organization licensees that 13maintain advance deposit wagering systems and advance deposit 14wagering licensees that contract with organization licensees 15shall provide sufficiently detailed monthly accountings to the 16horsemen association representing the largest number of 17owners, trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race 18horses at that organization licensee's racing meeting so that 19the horsemen association, as an interested party, can confirm 20the accuracy of the amounts paid to the purse account at the 21horsemen association's affiliated organization licensee from 22advance deposit wagering. If more than one breed races at the 23same race track facility, then the 50% of the moneys to be paid 24to an organization licensee's purse account shall be allocated 25among all organization licensees' purse accounts operating at 26that race track facility proportionately based on the actual   10400SB1473sam002- 37 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1number of host days that the Board grants to that breed at that 2race track facility in the current calendar year. To the 3extent any fees from advance deposit wagering conducted in 4Illinois for wagers in Illinois or other states have been 5placed in escrow or otherwise withheld from wagers pending a 6determination of the legality of advance deposit wagering, no 7action shall be brought to declare such wagers or the 8disbursement of any fees previously escrowed illegal.9        (1) Between the hours of 6:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. an 10    inter-track wagering licensee other than the host track 11    may supplement the host track simulcast program with 12    additional simulcast races or race programs, provided that 13    between January 1 and the third Friday in February of any 14    year, inclusive, if no live thoroughbred racing is 15    occurring in Illinois during this period, only 16    thoroughbred races may be used for supplemental interstate 17    simulcast purposes. The Board shall withhold approval for 18    a supplemental interstate simulcast only if it finds that 19    the simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of 20    racing.

In addition to 4considering all other requirements under this Act, in deciding 5whether to approve the operation of video gaming terminals by 6a terminal operator in a location, the Board shall consider 7the impact of any economic concentration of such operation of 8video gaming terminals. The Board shall not allow a terminal 9operator to operate video gaming terminals if the Board 10determines such operation will result in undue economic 11concentration. For purposes of this Section, "undue economic 12concentration" means that a terminal operator would have such 13actual or potential influence over video gaming terminals in 14Illinois as to:15        (1) substantially impede or suppress competition among 16    terminal operators;17        (2) adversely impact the economic stability of the 18    video gaming industry in Illinois; or19        (3) negatively impact the purposes of the Video Gaming 20    Act.21    The Board shall adopt rules concerning undue economic 22concentration with respect to the operation of video gaming 23terminals in Illinois. The rules shall include, but not be 24limited to, (i) limitations on the number of video gaming 25terminals operated by any terminal operator within a defined 26geographic radius and (ii) guidelines on the discontinuation   10400SB1473sam002- 84 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1of operation of any such video gaming terminals the Board 2determines will cause undue economic concentration. 3    (j) The provisions of the Illinois Antitrust Act are fully 4and equally applicable to the activities of any licensee under 5this Act. 6(Source: P.A. 101-31, eff. 6-28-19; 102-689, eff. 12-17-21.) 7    (230 ILCS 40/55)8    Sec. 55.

Video gaming terminals in a licensed location shall 17be operated only during the same hours of operation generally 18permitted to holders of a license under the Liquor Control Act 19of 1934 within the unit of local government in which they are 20located. A licensed truck stop establishment or licensed large 21truck stop establishment that does not hold a liquor license 22or an organization licensee under Section 76 may operate video 23gaming terminals on a continuous basis.

The General 22Assembly finds that the minimum live racing guarantees 23contained in subsections (e-1), (e-2), and (e-3) are in the 24best interest of the sport of horse racing, and that such 25guarantees may only be reduced in the calendar year in which 26they will be conducted in the limited circumstances described   10400SB1473sam002- 22 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1in this subsection. The Board may decrease the number of 2racing days without affecting an organization licensee's 3ability to conduct gaming pursuant to an organization gaming 4license issued under the Illinois Gambling Act only if the 5Board determines, after notice and hearing, that: 6        (i) a decrease is necessary to maintain a sufficient 7    number of betting interests per race to ensure the 8    integrity of racing; 9        (ii) there are unsafe track conditions due to weather 10    or acts of God;11        (iii) there is an agreement between an organization 12    licensee and the breed association that is applicable to 13    the involved live racing guarantee, such association 14    representing either the largest number of thoroughbred 15    owners and trainers or the largest number of standardbred 16    owners, trainers and drivers who race horses at the 17    involved organization licensee's racing meeting, so long 18    as the agreement does not compromise the integrity of the 19    sport of horse racing; or20        (iv) the horse population or purse levels are 21    insufficient to provide the number of racing opportunities 22    otherwise required in this Act. 23    In decreasing the number of racing dates in accordance 24with this subsection, the Board shall hold a hearing and shall 25provide the public and all interested parties notice and an 26opportunity to be heard. The Board shall accept testimony from   10400SB1473sam002- 23 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1all interested parties, including any association representing 2owners, trainers, jockeys, or drivers who will be affected by 3the decrease in racing dates.

The written explanation shall include a 6listing and content of all communication between any party and 7any Illinois Racing Board member or staff that does not take 8place at a public meeting of the Board. 9    (e-5) In reviewing an application for the purpose of 10granting an organization license consistent with the best 11interests of the public and the sport of horse racing, the 12Board shall consider: 13        (1) the character, reputation, experience, and 14    financial integrity of the applicant and of any other 15    separate person that either: 16            (i) controls the applicant, directly or 17        indirectly, or 18            (ii) is controlled, directly or indirectly, by 19        that applicant or by a person who controls, directly 20        or indirectly, that applicant; 21        (2) the applicant's facilities or proposed facilities 22    for conducting horse racing; 23        (3) the total revenue without regard to Section 32.1 24    to be derived by the State and horsemen from the 25    applicant's conducting a race meeting; 26        (4) the applicant's good faith affirmative action plan   10400SB1473sam002- 24 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1    to recruit, train, and upgrade minorities in all 2    employment classifications; 3        (5) the applicant's financial ability to purchase and 4    maintain adequate liability and casualty insurance; 5        (6) the applicant's proposed and prior year's 6    promotional and marketing activities and expenditures of 7    the applicant associated with those activities; 8        (7) an agreement, if any, among organization licensees 9    as provided in subsection (b) of Section 21 of this Act; 10    and 11        (8) the extent to which the applicant exceeds or meets 12    other standards for the issuance of an organization 13    license that the Board shall adopt by rule.14    In granting organization licenses and allocating dates for 15horse race meetings, the Board shall have discretion to 16determine an overall schedule, including required simulcasts 17of Illinois races by host tracks that will, in its judgment, be 18conducive to the best interests of the public and the sport of 19horse racing.20    (e-10) The Illinois Administrative Procedure Act shall 21apply to administrative procedures of the Board under this Act 22for the granting of an organization license, except that (1) 23notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of Section 2410-40 of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act regarding 25cross-examination, the Board may prescribe rules limiting the 26right of an applicant or participant in any proceeding to   10400SB1473sam002- 25 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1award an organization license to conduct cross-examination of 2witnesses at that proceeding where that cross-examination 3would unduly obstruct the timely award of an organization 4license under subsection (e) of Section 20 of this Act; (2) the 5provisions of Section 10-45 of the Illinois Administrative 6Procedure Act regarding proposals for decision are excluded 7under this Act; (3) notwithstanding the provisions of 8subsection (a) of Section 10-60 of the Illinois Administrative 9Procedure Act regarding ex parte communications, the Board may 10prescribe rules allowing ex parte communications with 11applicants or participants in a proceeding to award an 12organization license where conducting those communications 13would be in the best interest of racing, provided all those 14communications are made part of the record of that proceeding 15pursuant to subsection (c) of Section 10-60 of the Illinois 16Administrative Procedure Act; (4) the provisions of Section 1714a of this Act and the rules of the Board promulgated under 18that Section shall apply instead of the provisions of Article 1910 of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act regarding 20administrative law judges; and (5) the provisions of 21subsection (d) of Section 10-65 of the Illinois Administrative 22Procedure Act that prevent summary suspension of a license 23pending revocation or other action shall not apply.24    (f) The Board may allot racing dates to an organization 25licensee for more than one calendar year but for no more than 3 26successive calendar years in advance, provided that the Board   10400SB1473sam002- 26 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1shall review such allotment for more than one calendar year 2prior to each year for which such allotment has been made. The 3granting of an organization license to a person constitutes a 4privilege to conduct a horse race meeting under the provisions 5of this Act, and no person granted an organization license 6shall be deemed to have a vested interest, property right, or 7future expectation to receive an organization license in any 8subsequent year as a result of the granting of an organization 9license. Organization licenses shall be subject to revocation 10if the organization licensee has violated any provision of 11this Act or the rules and regulations promulgated under this 12Act or has been convicted of a crime or has failed to disclose 13or has stated falsely any information called for in the 14application for an organization license. Any organization 15license revocation proceeding shall be in accordance with 16Section 16 regarding suspension and revocation of occupation 17licenses.18    (f-5) If, (i) an applicant does not file an acceptance of 19the racing dates awarded by the Board as required under part 20(1) of subsection (h) of this Section 20, or (ii) an 21organization licensee has its license suspended or revoked 22under this Act, the Board, upon conducting an emergency 23hearing as provided for in this Act, may reaward on an 24emergency basis pursuant to rules established by the Board, 25racing dates not accepted or the racing dates associated with 26any suspension or revocation period to one or more   10400SB1473sam002- 27 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1organization licensees, new applicants, or any combination 2thereof, upon terms and conditions that the Board determines 3are in the best interest of racing, provided, the organization 4licensees or new applicants receiving the awarded racing dates 5file an acceptance of those reawarded racing dates as required 6under paragraph (1) of subsection (h) of this Section 20 and 7comply with the other provisions of this Act. The Illinois 8Administrative Procedure Act shall not apply to the 9administrative procedures of the Board in conducting the 10emergency hearing and the reallocation of racing dates on an 11emergency basis.12    (g) (Blank).13    (h) The Board shall send the applicant a copy of its 14formally executed order by certified mail addressed to the 15applicant at the address stated in his application, which 16notice shall be mailed within 5 days of the date the formal 17order is executed.18    Each applicant notified shall, within 10 days after 19receipt of the final executed order of the Board awarding 20racing dates: 21        (1) file with the Board an acceptance of such award in 22    the form prescribed by the Board; 23        (2) pay to the Board an additional amount equal to 24    $110 for each racing date awarded; and 25        (3) file with the Board the bonds required in Sections 26    21 and 25 at least 20 days prior to the first day of each   10400SB1473sam002- 28 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1    race meeting.2Upon compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (1), (2), 3and (3) of this subsection (h), the applicant shall be issued 4an organization license.5    If any applicant fails to comply with this Section or 6fails to pay the organization license fees herein provided, no 7organization license shall be issued to such applicant.8(Source: P.A. 101-31, eff. 6-28-19.) 9    (230 ILCS 5/26)  (from Ch. 8, par. 37-26)10    Sec. 26. Wagering. 11    (a) Any licensee may conduct and supervise the pari-mutuel 12system of wagering, as defined in Section 3.12 of this Act, on 13horse races conducted by an Illinois organization licensee or 14conducted at a racetrack located in another state or country 15in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 26 of this Act. 16Subject to the prior consent of the Board, licensees may 17supplement any pari-mutuel pool in order to guarantee a 18minimum distribution. Such pari-mutuel method of wagering 19shall not, under any circumstances if conducted under the 20provisions of this Act, be held or construed to be unlawful, 21other statutes of this State to the contrary notwithstanding. 22Subject to rules for advance wagering promulgated by the 23Board, any licensee may accept wagers in advance of the day the 24race wagered upon occurs.25    (b) Except for those gaming activities for which a license   10400SB1473sam002- 29 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1is obtained and authorized under the Illinois Lottery Law, the 2Charitable Games Act, the Raffles and Poker Runs Act, the 3Video Gaming Act, or the Illinois Gambling Act, no other 4method of betting, pool making, wagering or gambling shall be 5used or permitted by the licensee. Each licensee may retain, 6subject to the payment of all applicable taxes and purses, an 7amount not to exceed 17% of all money wagered under subsection 8(a) of this Section, except as may otherwise be permitted 9under this Act.10    (b-5) An individual may place a wager under the 11pari-mutuel system from any licensed location authorized under 12this Act provided that wager is electronically recorded in the 13manner described in Section 3.12 of this Act. Any wager made 14electronically by an individual while physically on the 15premises of a licensee shall be deemed to have been made at the 16premises of that licensee.17    (c) (Blank).18    (c-5) The sum held by any licensee for payment of 19outstanding pari-mutuel tickets, if unclaimed prior to 20December 31 of the next year, shall be retained by the licensee 21for payment of such tickets until that date. Within 10 days 22thereafter, the balance of such sum remaining unclaimed, less 23any uncashed supplements contributed by such licensee for the 24purpose of guaranteeing minimum distributions of any 25pari-mutuel pool, shall be evenly distributed to the purse 26account of the organization licensee and the organization   10400SB1473sam002- 30 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1licensee, except that the balance of the sum of all 2outstanding pari-mutuel tickets generated from simulcast 3wagering and inter-track wagering by an organization licensee 4located in a county with a population in excess of 230,000 and 5borders the Mississippi River or any licensee that derives its 6license from that organization licensee shall be evenly 7distributed to the purse account of the organization licensee 8and the organization licensee.9    (d) A pari-mutuel ticket shall be honored until December 1031 of the next calendar year, and the licensee shall pay the 11same and may charge the amount thereof against unpaid money 12similarly accumulated on account of pari-mutuel tickets not 13presented for payment.14    (e) No licensee shall knowingly permit any minor, other 15than an employee of such licensee or an owner, trainer, 16jockey, driver, or employee thereof, to be admitted during a 17racing program unless accompanied by a parent or guardian, or 18any minor to be a patron of the pari-mutuel system of wagering 19conducted or supervised by it. The admission of any 20unaccompanied minor, other than an employee of the licensee or 21an owner, trainer, jockey, driver, or employee thereof at a 22race track is a Class C misdemeanor.23    (f) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Act, an 24organization licensee may contract with an entity in another 25state or country to permit any legal wagering entity in 26another state or country to accept wagers solely within such   10400SB1473sam002- 31 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1other state or country on races conducted by the organization 2licensee in this State. Beginning January 1, 2000, these 3wagers shall not be subject to State taxation. Until January 41, 2000, when the out-of-State entity conducts a pari-mutuel 5pool separate from the organization licensee, a privilege tax 6equal to 7 1/2% of all monies received by the organization 7licensee from entities in other states or countries pursuant 8to such contracts is imposed on the organization licensee, and 9such privilege tax shall be remitted to the Department of 10Revenue within 48 hours of receipt of the moneys from the 11simulcast. When the out-of-State entity conducts a combined 12pari-mutuel pool with the organization licensee, the tax shall 13be 10% of all monies received by the organization licensee 14with 25% of the receipts from this 10% tax to be distributed to 15the county in which the race was conducted.16    An organization licensee may permit one or more of its 17races to be utilized for pari-mutuel wagering at one or more 18locations in other states and may transmit audio and visual 19signals of races the organization licensee conducts to one or 20more locations outside the State or country and may also 21permit pari-mutuel pools in other states or countries to be 22combined with its gross or net wagering pools or with wagering 23pools established by other states.24    (g) A host track may accept interstate simulcast wagers on 25horse races conducted in other states or countries and shall 26control the number of signals and types of breeds of racing in   10400SB1473sam002- 32 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1its simulcast program, subject to the disapproval of the 2Board. The Board may prohibit a simulcast program only if it 3finds that the simulcast program is clearly adverse to the 4integrity of racing. The host track simulcast program shall 5include the signal of live racing of all organization 6licensees. All non-host licensees and advance deposit wagering 7licensees shall carry the signal of and accept wagers on live 8racing of all organization licensees. Advance deposit wagering 9licensees shall not be permitted to accept out-of-state wagers 10on any Illinois signal provided pursuant to this Section 11without the approval and consent of the organization licensee 12providing the signal. For one year after August 15, 2014 (the 13effective date of Public Act 98-968), non-host licensees may 14carry the host track simulcast program and shall accept wagers 15on all races included as part of the simulcast program of horse 16races conducted at race tracks located within North America 17upon which wagering is permitted. For a period of one year 18after August 15, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 1998-968), on horse races conducted at race tracks located 20outside of North America, non-host licensees may accept wagers 21on all races included as part of the simulcast program upon 22which wagering is permitted. Beginning August 15, 2015 (one 23year after the effective date of Public Act 98-968), non-host 24licensees may carry the host track simulcast program and shall 25accept wagers on all races included as part of the simulcast 26program upon which wagering is permitted. All organization   10400SB1473sam002- 33 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1licensees shall provide their live signal to all advance 2deposit wagering licensees for a simulcast commission fee not 3to exceed 6% of the advance deposit wagering licensee's 4Illinois handle on the organization licensee's signal without 5prior approval by the Board. The Board may adopt rules under 6which it may permit simulcast commission fees in excess of 6%. 7The Board shall adopt rules limiting the interstate commission 8fees charged to an advance deposit wagering licensee. The 9Board shall adopt rules regarding advance deposit wagering on 10interstate simulcast races that shall reflect, among other 11things, the General Assembly's desire to maximize revenues to 12the State, horsemen purses, and organization licensees. 13However, organization licensees providing live signals 14pursuant to the requirements of this subsection (g) may 15petition the Board to withhold their live signals from an 16advance deposit wagering licensee if the organization licensee 17discovers and the Board finds reputable or credible 18information that the advance deposit wagering licensee is 19under investigation by another state or federal governmental 20agency, the advance deposit wagering licensee's license has 21been suspended in another state, or the advance deposit 22wagering licensee's license is in revocation proceedings in 23another state. The organization licensee's provision of their 24live signal to an advance deposit wagering licensee under this 25subsection (g) pertains to wagers placed from within Illinois. 26Advance deposit wagering licensees may place advance deposit   10400SB1473sam002- 34 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1wagering terminals at wagering facilities as a convenience to 2customers. The advance deposit wagering licensee shall not 3charge or collect any fee from purses for the placement of the 4advance deposit wagering terminals. The costs and expenses of 5the host track and non-host licensees associated with 6interstate simulcast wagering, other than the interstate 7commission fee, shall be borne by the host track and all 8non-host licensees incurring these costs. The interstate 9commission fee shall not exceed 5% of Illinois handle on the 10interstate simulcast race or races without prior approval of 11the Board. The Board shall promulgate rules under which it may 12permit interstate commission fees in excess of 5%. The 13interstate commission fee and other fees charged by the 14sending racetrack, including, but not limited to, satellite 15decoder fees, shall be uniformly applied to the host track and 16all non-host licensees.17    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, an 18organization licensee, with the consent of the horsemen 19association representing the largest number of owners, 20trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race horses at 21that organization licensee's racing meeting, may maintain a 22system whereby advance deposit wagering may take place or an 23organization licensee, with the consent of the horsemen 24association representing the largest number of owners, 25trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race horses at 26that organization licensee's racing meeting, may contract with   10400SB1473sam002- 35 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1another person to carry out a system of advance deposit 2wagering. Such consent may not be unreasonably withheld. Only 3with respect to an appeal to the Board that consent for an 4organization licensee that maintains its own advance deposit 5wagering system is being unreasonably withheld, the Board 6shall issue a final order within 30 days after initiation of 7the appeal, and the organization licensee's advance deposit 8wagering system may remain operational during that 30-day 9period. The actions of any organization licensee who conducts 10advance deposit wagering or any person who has a contract with 11an organization licensee to conduct advance deposit wagering 12who conducts advance deposit wagering on or after January 1, 132013 and prior to June 7, 2013 (the effective date of Public 14Act 98-18) taken in reliance on the changes made to this 15subsection (g) by Public Act 98-18 are hereby validated, 16provided payment of all applicable pari-mutuel taxes are 17remitted to the Board. All advance deposit wagers placed from 18within Illinois must be placed through a Board-approved 19advance deposit wagering licensee; no other entity may accept 20an advance deposit wager from a person within Illinois. All 21advance deposit wagering is subject to any rules adopted by 22the Board. The Board may adopt rules necessary to regulate 23advance deposit wagering through the use of emergency 24rulemaking in accordance with Section 5-45 of the Illinois 25Administrative Procedure Act. The General Assembly finds that 26the adoption of rules to regulate advance deposit wagering is   10400SB1473sam002- 36 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1deemed an emergency and necessary for the public interest, 2safety, and welfare. An advance deposit wagering licensee may 3retain all moneys as agreed to by contract with an 4organization licensee. Any moneys retained by the organization 5licensee from advance deposit wagering, not including moneys 6retained by the advance deposit wagering licensee, shall be 7paid 50% to the organization licensee's purse account and 50% 8to the organization licensee. With the exception of any 9organization licensee that is owned by a publicly traded 10company that is incorporated in a state other than Illinois 11and advance deposit wagering licensees under contract with 12such organization licensees, organization licensees that 13maintain advance deposit wagering systems and advance deposit 14wagering licensees that contract with organization licensees 15shall provide sufficiently detailed monthly accountings to the 16horsemen association representing the largest number of 17owners, trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race 18horses at that organization licensee's racing meeting so that 19the horsemen association, as an interested party, can confirm 20the accuracy of the amounts paid to the purse account at the 21horsemen association's affiliated organization licensee from 22advance deposit wagering. If more than one breed races at the 23same race track facility, then the 50% of the moneys to be paid 24to an organization licensee's purse account shall be allocated 25among all organization licensees' purse accounts operating at 26that race track facility proportionately based on the actual   10400SB1473sam002- 37 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1number of host days that the Board grants to that breed at that 2race track facility in the current calendar year. To the 3extent any fees from advance deposit wagering conducted in 4Illinois for wagers in Illinois or other states have been 5placed in escrow or otherwise withheld from wagers pending a 6determination of the legality of advance deposit wagering, no 7action shall be brought to declare such wagers or the 8disbursement of any fees previously escrowed illegal.9        (1) Between the hours of 6:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. an 10    inter-track wagering licensee other than the host track 11    may supplement the host track simulcast program with 12    additional simulcast races or race programs, provided that 13    between January 1 and the third Friday in February of any 14    year, inclusive, if no live thoroughbred racing is 15    occurring in Illinois during this period, only 16    thoroughbred races may be used for supplemental interstate 17    simulcast purposes. The Board shall withhold approval for 18    a supplemental interstate simulcast only if it finds that 19    the simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of 20    racing. A supplemental interstate simulcast may be 21    transmitted from an inter-track wagering licensee to its 22    affiliated non-host licensees. The interstate commission 23    fee for a supplemental interstate simulcast shall be paid 24    by the non-host licensee and its affiliated non-host 25    licensees receiving the simulcast.26        (2) Between the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. an   10400SB1473sam002- 38 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1    inter-track wagering licensee other than the host track 2    may receive supplemental interstate simulcasts only with 3    the consent of the host track, except when the Board finds 4    that the simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of 5    racing. Consent granted under this paragraph (2) to any 6    inter-track wagering licensee shall be deemed consent to 7    all non-host licensees. The interstate commission fee for 8    the supplemental interstate simulcast shall be paid by all 9    participating non-host licensees.10        (3) Each licensee conducting interstate simulcast 11    wagering may retain, subject to the payment of all 12    applicable taxes and the purses, an amount not to exceed 13    17% of all money wagered. If any licensee conducts the 14    pari-mutuel system wagering on races conducted at 15    racetracks in another state or country, each such race or 16    race program shall be considered a separate racing day for 17    the purpose of determining the daily handle and computing 18    the privilege tax of that daily handle as provided in 19    subsection (a) of Section 27. Until January 1, 2000, from 20    the sums permitted to be retained pursuant to this 21    subsection, each inter-track wagering location licensee 22    shall pay 1% of the pari-mutuel handle wagered on 23    simulcast wagering to the Horse Racing Tax Allocation 24    Fund, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B) of 25    paragraph (11) of subsection (h) of Section 26 of this 26    Act.  10400SB1473sam002- 39 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1        (4) A licensee who receives an interstate simulcast 2    may combine its gross or net pools with pools at the 3    sending racetracks pursuant to rules established by the 4    Board. All licensees combining their gross pools at a 5    sending racetrack shall adopt the takeout percentages of 6    the sending racetrack. A licensee may also establish a 7    separate pool and takeout structure for wagering purposes 8    on races conducted at race tracks outside of the State of 9    Illinois. The licensee may permit pari-mutuel wagers 10    placed in other states or countries to be combined with 11    its gross or net wagering pools or other wagering pools.12        (5) After the payment of the interstate commission fee 13    (except for the interstate commission fee on a 14    supplemental interstate simulcast, which shall be paid by 15    the host track and by each non-host licensee through the 16    host track) and all applicable State and local taxes, 17    except as provided in subsection (g) of Section 27 of this 18    Act, the remainder of moneys retained from simulcast 19    wagering pursuant to this subsection (g), and Section 26.2 20    shall be divided as follows:21            (A) For interstate simulcast wagers made at a host 22        track, 50% to the host track and 50% to purses at the 23        host track.24            (B) For wagers placed on interstate simulcast 25        races, supplemental simulcasts as defined in 26        subparagraphs (1) and (2), and separately pooled races   10400SB1473sam002- 40 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1        conducted outside of the State of Illinois made at a 2        non-host licensee, 25% to the host track, 25% to the 3        non-host licensee, and 50% to the purses at the host 4        track.5        (6) Notwithstanding any provision in this Act to the 6    contrary, non-host licensees who derive their licenses 7    from a track located in a county with a population in 8    excess of 230,000 and that borders the Mississippi River 9    or Macon County may receive supplemental interstate 10    simulcast races at all times subject to Board approval, 11    which shall be withheld only upon a finding that a 12    supplemental interstate simulcast is clearly adverse to 13    the integrity of racing.14        (7) Effective January 1, 2017, notwithstanding any 15    provision of this Act to the contrary, after payment of 16    all applicable State and local taxes and interstate 17    commission fees, non-host licensees who derive their 18    licenses from a track located in a county with a 19    population in excess of 230,000 and that borders the 20    Mississippi River or Macon County shall retain 50% of the 21    retention from interstate simulcast wagers and shall pay 22    50% to purses at the track from which the non-host 23    licensee derives its license.24        (7.1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act 25    to the contrary, if no standardbred racing is conducted at 26    a racetrack located in Madison County during any calendar   10400SB1473sam002- 41 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1    year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, and the 2    licensee that conducts horse racing at that racetrack 3    requests from the Board at least as many racing dates as 4    were conducted in calendar year 2000, all moneys derived 5    by that racetrack from simulcast wagering and inter-track 6    wagering that (1) are to be used for purses and (2) are 7    generated between the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. 8    during that calendar year shall be paid as follows:9            (A) Eighty percent shall be paid to its 10        thoroughbred purse account; and11            (B) Twenty percent shall be deposited into the 12        Illinois Colt Stakes Purse Distribution Fund and shall 13        be paid to purses for standardbred races for Illinois 14        conceived and foaled horses conducted at any county 15        fairgrounds.

The Board shall 4adopt rules to implement the provisions of this paragraph.5    Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (h), the 6Board may license an organization license under Section 76. 7    (h-5) Restrictions on licenses in malls. The Board shall 8not grant an application to become a licensed video gaming 9location if the Board determines that granting the application 10would more likely than not cause a terminal operator, 11individually or in combination with other terminal operators, 12licensed video gaming location, or other person or entity, to 13operate the video gaming terminals in 2 or more licensed video 14gaming locations as a single video gaming operation.15        (1) In making determinations under this subsection 16    (h-5), factors to be considered by the Board shall 17    include, but not be limited to, the following:18            (A) the physical aspects of the location;19            (B) the ownership, control, or management of the 20        location;21            (C) any arrangements, understandings, or 22        agreements, written or otherwise, among or involving 23        any persons or entities that involve the conducting of 24        any video gaming business or the sharing of costs or 25        revenues; and26            (D) the manner in which any terminal operator or   10400SB1473sam002- 82 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1        other related entity markets, advertises, or otherwise 2        describes any location or locations to any other 3        person or entity or to the public.4        (2) The Board shall presume, subject to rebuttal, that 5    the granting of an application to become a licensed video 6    gaming location within a mall will cause a terminal 7    operator, individually or in combination with other 8    persons or entities, to operate the video gaming terminals 9    in 2 or more licensed video gaming locations as a single 10    video gaming operation if the Board determines that 11    granting the license would create a local concentration of 12    licensed video gaming locations.13    For the purposes of this subsection (h-5):14    "Mall" means a building, or adjoining or connected 15buildings, containing 4 or more separate locations.16    "Video gaming operation" means the conducting of video 17gaming and all related activities.18    "Location" means a space within a mall containing a 19separate business, a place for a separate business, or a place 20subject to a separate leasing arrangement by the mall owner.21    "Licensed video gaming location" means a licensed 22establishment, licensed fraternal establishment, licensed 23veterans establishment, licensed truck stop establishment, or 24licensed large truck stop.25    "Local concentration of licensed video gaming locations" 26means that the combined number of licensed video gaming   10400SB1473sam002- 83 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1locations within a mall exceed half of the separate locations 2within the mall. 3    (i) Undue economic concentration. In addition to 4considering all other requirements under this Act, in deciding 5whether to approve the operation of video gaming terminals by 6a terminal operator in a location, the Board shall consider 7the impact of any economic concentration of such operation of 8video gaming terminals. The Board shall not allow a terminal 9operator to operate video gaming terminals if the Board 10determines such operation will result in undue economic 11concentration. For purposes of this Section, "undue economic 12concentration" means that a terminal operator would have such 13actual or potential influence over video gaming terminals in 14Illinois as to:15        (1) substantially impede or suppress competition among 16    terminal operators;17        (2) adversely impact the economic stability of the 18    video gaming industry in Illinois; or19        (3) negatively impact the purposes of the Video Gaming 20    Act.21    The Board shall adopt rules concerning undue economic 22concentration with respect to the operation of video gaming 23terminals in Illinois. The rules shall include, but not be 24limited to, (i) limitations on the number of video gaming 25terminals operated by any terminal operator within a defined 26geographic radius and (ii) guidelines on the discontinuation   10400SB1473sam002- 84 -LRB104 09432 LNS 29096 a1of operation of any such video gaming terminals the Board 2determines will cause undue economic concentration. 3    (j) The provisions of the Illinois Antitrust Act are fully 4and equally applicable to the activities of any licensee under 5this Act. 6(Source: P.A. 101-31, eff. 6-28-19; 102-689, eff. 12-17-21.) 7    (230 ILCS 40/55)8    Sec. 55.
