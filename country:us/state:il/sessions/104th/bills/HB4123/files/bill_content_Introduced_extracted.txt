The 17Environmental Protection Agency, Illinois Power Agency, and 18Illinois Commerce Commission shall consult PJM 19Interconnection, LLC and Midcontinent Independent System 20Operator, Inc., or their respective successor organizations 21regarding forecasted resource adequacy and reliability needs, 22anticipated new generation interconnection, new transmission 23development or upgrades, and any announced large GHG-emitting 24unit closure dates and include this information in the report. 25The report shall be released publicly by no later than 26December 15 of the year it is prepared. If the Environmental   HB4123- 12 -LRB104 15315 JDS 28469 b1Protection Agency, Illinois Power Agency, and Illinois 2Commerce Commission jointly conclude in the report that the 3data from the regional grid operators, the pace of renewable 4energy development, the pace of development of energy storage 5and demand response utilization, transmission capacity, and 6the CO2e and copollutant emissions reductions required by 7subsection (i) or (k-5) reasonably demonstrate that a resource 8adequacy shortfall will occur, including whether there will be 9sufficient in-state capacity to meet the zonal requirements of 10MISO Zone 4 or the PJM ComEd Zone, per the requirements of the 11regional transmission organizations, or that the regional 12transmission operators determine that a reliability violation 13will occur during the time frame the study is evaluating, then 14the Illinois Power Agency, in conjunction with the 15Environmental Protection Agency shall develop a plan to reduce 16or delay CO2e and copollutant emissions reductions 17requirements only to the extent and for the duration necessary 18to meet the resource adequacy and reliability needs of the 19State, including allowing any plants whose emission reduction 20deadline has been identified in the plan as creating a 21reliability concern to continue operating, including operating 22with reduced emissions or as emergency backup where 23appropriate. The plan shall also consider the use of renewable 24energy, energy storage, demand response, transmission 25development, or other strategies to resolve the identified 26resource adequacy shortfall or reliability violation.  HB4123- 13 -LRB104 15315 JDS 28469 b1        (1) In developing the plan, the Environmental 2    Protection Agency and the Illinois Power Agency shall hold 3    at least one workshop open to, and accessible at a time and 4    place convenient to, the public and shall consider any 5    comments made by stakeholders or the public. Upon 6    development of the plan, copies of the plan shall be 7    posted and made publicly available on the Environmental 8    Protection Agency's, the Illinois Power Agency's, and the 9    Illinois Commerce Commission's websites. All interested 10    parties shall have 60 days following the date of posting 11    to provide comment to the Environmental Protection Agency 12    and the Illinois Power Agency on the plan. All comments 13    submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency and the 14    Illinois Power Agency shall be encouraged to be specific, 15    supported by data or other detailed analyses, and, if 16    objecting to all or a portion of the plan, accompanied by 17    specific alternative wording or proposals. All comments 18    shall be posted on the Environmental Protection Agency's, 19    the Illinois Power Agency's, and the Illinois Commerce 20    Commission's websites. Within 30 days following the end of 21    the 60-day review period, the Environmental Protection 22    Agency and the Illinois Power Agency shall revise the plan 23    as necessary based on the comments received and file its 24    revised plan with the Illinois Commerce Commission for 25    approval.26        (2) Within 60 days after the filing of the revised   HB4123- 14 -LRB104 15315 JDS 28469 b1    plan at the Illinois Commerce Commission, any person 2    objecting to the plan shall file an objection with the 3    Illinois Commerce Commission. Within 30 days after the 4    expiration of the comment period, the Illinois Commerce 5    Commission shall determine whether an evidentiary hearing 6    is necessary. The Illinois Commerce Commission shall also 7    host 3 public hearings within 90 days after the plan is 8    filed. Following the evidentiary and public hearings, the 9    Illinois Commerce Commission shall enter its order 10    approving or approving with modifications the reliability 11    mitigation plan within 180 days.12        (3) The Illinois Commerce Commission shall only 13    approve the plan if the Illinois Commerce Commission 14    determines that it will resolve the resource adequacy or 15    reliability deficiency identified in the reliability 16    mitigation plan at the least amount of CO2e and copollutant 17    emissions, taking into consideration the emissions impacts 18    on environmental justice communities, and that it will 19    ensure adequate, reliable, affordable, efficient, and 20    environmentally sustainable electric service at the lowest 21    total cost over time, taking into account the impact of 22    increases in emissions.23        (4) If the resource adequacy or reliability deficiency 24    identified in the reliability mitigation plan is resolved 25    or reduced, the Environmental Protection Agency and the 26    Illinois Power Agency may file an amended plan adjusting   HB4123- 15 -LRB104 15315 JDS 28469 b1    the reduction or delay in CO2e and copollutant emission 2    reduction requirements identified in the plan. 3(Source: P.A. 102-662, eff. 9-15-21; 102-1031, eff. 5-27-22.) 4    Section 99.

Upon 6    development of the plan, copies of the plan shall be 7    posted and made publicly available on the Environmental 8    Protection Agency's, the Illinois Power Agency's, and the 9    Illinois Commerce Commission's websites. All interested 10    parties shall have 60 days following the date of posting 11    to provide comment to the Environmental Protection Agency 12    and the Illinois Power Agency on the plan. All comments 13    submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency and the 14    Illinois Power Agency shall be encouraged to be specific, 15    supported by data or other detailed analyses, and, if 16    objecting to all or a portion of the plan, accompanied by 17    specific alternative wording or proposals. All comments 18    shall be posted on the Environmental Protection Agency's, 19    the Illinois Power Agency's, and the Illinois Commerce 20    Commission's websites. Within 30 days following the end of 21    the 60-day review period, the Environmental Protection 22    Agency and the Illinois Power Agency shall revise the plan 23    as necessary based on the comments received and file its 24    revised plan with the Illinois Commerce Commission for 25    approval.26        (2) Within 60 days after the filing of the revised   HB4123- 14 -LRB104 15315 JDS 28469 b1    plan at the Illinois Commerce Commission, any person 2    objecting to the plan shall file an objection with the 3    Illinois Commerce Commission. Within 30 days after the 4    expiration of the comment period, the Illinois Commerce 5    Commission shall determine whether an evidentiary hearing 6    is necessary. The Illinois Commerce Commission shall also 7    host 3 public hearings within 90 days after the plan is 8    filed. Following the evidentiary and public hearings, the 9    Illinois Commerce Commission shall enter its order 10    approving or approving with modifications the reliability 11    mitigation plan within 180 days.12        (3) The Illinois Commerce Commission shall only 13    approve the plan if the Illinois Commerce Commission 14    determines that it will resolve the resource adequacy or 15    reliability deficiency identified in the reliability 16    mitigation plan at the least amount of CO2e and copollutant 17    emissions, taking into consideration the emissions impacts 18    on environmental justice communities, and that it will 19    ensure adequate, reliable, affordable, efficient, and 20    environmentally sustainable electric service at the lowest 21    total cost over time, taking into account the impact of 22    increases in emissions.23        (4) If the resource adequacy or reliability deficiency 24    identified in the reliability mitigation plan is resolved 25    or reduced, the Environmental Protection Agency and the 26    Illinois Power Agency may file an amended plan adjusting   HB4123- 15 -LRB104 15315 JDS 28469 b1    the reduction or delay in CO2e and copollutant emission 2    reduction requirements identified in the plan. 3(Source: P.A. 102-662, eff. 9-15-21; 102-1031, eff. 5-27-22.) 4    Section 99.
